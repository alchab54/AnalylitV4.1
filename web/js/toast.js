// This file is deprecated. All toast functionalities are now handled by ui-improved.js.
// Please remove this file from your project.
//
// If you need to use showToast, showSuccess, or showError,
// import them from 'ui-improved.js'.
//
// Example:
// import { showToast, showSuccess, showError } from './ui-improved.js';
//
// The old implementation was basic and lacked features like accessibility,
// action buttons, and a toast pool, which are now available in ui-improved.js.
