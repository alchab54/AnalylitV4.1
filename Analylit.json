  {"id":"aafjes-vandoornPredictingWorkingAlliance2025","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Session-by-session tracking of the working alliance enables clinicians to detect alliance deterioration and intervene accordingly, which has shown to improve treatment outcome, and reduce dropout. Despite this, regular use of alliance self-report measures has failed to gain widespread implementation. We aimed to develop an automated alliance prediction using behavioral features obtained from video-recorded therapy sessions.\nMETHOD: A naturalistic dataset of session recordings with patient-ratings of working alliance was available for 252 in-person and teletherapy sessions from 47 patients treated by 10 clinicians. Text and audio-based features were extracted from all 252 sessions. Additional video-based feature extraction was possible for a subsample of 80 sessions. We developed a modeling pipeline for audio and text and for audio, text and video to train machine learning regression models that fuse multimodal features.\nRESULTS: Best results were achieved with a Gradient Boosting architecture, when using audio, text, and video features extracted from the patient (ICC = 0.66, Pearson r = 0.70, MAE = 0.33).\nCONCLUSION: Automated alliance prediction from video-recorded therapy sessions is feasible with high accuracy. A data-driven multimodal approach to feature extraction and selection enables powerful models, outperforming previous work.","author":[{"family":"Aafjes-van Doorn","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Cicconet","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Cohn","given":"Jeffrey F."},{"family":"Aafjes","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"aafjes-vandoornPredictingWorkingAlliance2025","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research: Journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","container-title-short":"Psychother Res","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2024.2428702","ISSN":"1468-4381","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"256-270","PMID":"39743668","source":"PubMed","title":"Predicting working alliance in psychotherapy: A multi-modal machine learning approach","title-short":"Predicting working alliance in psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"aarabiTelerehabilitationChildrenPhysical2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Children with physical disabilities (Having this type of disability can be due to any of the reasons such as cerebral palsy, genetic, developmental, neurodevelopment and any other reasons that cause physical disability in the child) need rehabilitation services. Tele-rehabilitation is a practical approach to provide rehabilitation services for children with rapid and continuous access. This approach has been used more recently and overcomes the limitations of conventional rehabilitation, which involves wasting time, traveling distance, and cost. The purpose of this study is to examine the challenges of telerehabilitation for children with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy and developmental delay.\nMETHOD: This study was conducted with the qualitative approach of content analysis in order to investigate the challenges of tele-rehabilitation services in Tehran in 2023. Twenty-two participants were selected based on purposeful sampling with maximum variation. Data was gathered through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with children's parents and tele-rehabilitation service providers. The interviews lasted between 15 and 75 min, and MAXQDA 10 software was used for data analysis. The conventional content analysis method of Granheim and Lundman was used to analyze the data. In this research, four Guba and Lincoln criteria including creditability, dependency, conformability, and transferability were used to evaluate the trustworthiness of data. This article is part of a more extensive qualitative study that explored the barriers and facilitators of these services.\nFINDING: For the challenges of telerehabilitation services for these children, the researcher faced with 10 categories which were obtained after the investigation. The 10 categories are as follows: unorganized internet infrastructure, lack of a developed program, inefficient technology, disregard for ethical principles, lack of therapist information, visual and auditory limitations, cultural misconceptions, weakness of empathy and therapeutic alliance, Lack of familiarity with telerehabilitation, and the other online therapy problems.\nCONCLUSION: Finally, by identifying these challenges, it is possible to provide services with higher qualities to people of this group by reducing barriers. Also, the policy makers of the mentioned area should take more effective steps in order to provide this type of services to the families of children with physical disabilities, so that it ultimately leads to basic measures to improve the condition of these children.","author":[{"family":"Aarabi","given":"Mahta Alsadat"},{"family":"Abdi","given":"Kianoush"},{"family":"Soleimani","given":"Farin"}],"citation-key":"aarabiTelerehabilitationChildrenPhysical2025","container-title":"BMC pediatrics","container-title-short":"BMC Pediatr","DOI":"10.1186/s12887-024-05341-6","ISSN":"1471-2431","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"11","PMCID":"PMC11705707","PMID":"39773713","source":"PubMed","title":"Tele-rehabilitation for children with physical disabilities: qualitative exploration of challenges in Iran","title-short":"Tele-rehabilitation for children with physical disabilities","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"abargilHowTherapistsEmotion2022","abstract":"Empathy is an essential characteristic for therapists that explained 9% of the variance in treatment outcomes. Many measures of empathy are based on self-report questionnaires. Therefore, they reflect how a person perceives his empathic abilities, which can be biased from his true abilities. The ability to recognize emotions has been found to be related to empathy and serves as a measure for the use of empathic abilities. In this study, we examined therapists' empathic abilities, using a novel task for recognizing emotions, and looked at how they related to the therapy process and outcomes. The study included 33 patient-therapist dyads. Therapist empathy was assessed with an emotion detection task, the JeFEE. Clients filled questionnaires after each session regarding therapy progress and their symptoms. We found that emotion recognition moderated the change in (a) client secure attachment to therapist, (b) client avoidant attachment to therapist, (c) client working alliance, (d) client rate of tense or upset they felt during the session, (e) client lack of emotional clarity of emotions, (f) client non-acceptance of emotional responses, (g) client overall emotion regulation and (h) client main target complaint.

  {"id":"abdulrahmanExploringInfluenceUserspecific2022","abstract":"Virtual advisors (VAs) are being utilised almost in every service nowadays from entertainment to healthcare. To increase the user's trust in these VAs and encourage the users to follow their advice, they should have the capability of explaining their decisions, particularly, when the decision is vital such as health advice. However, the role of an explainable VA in health behaviour change is understudied. There is evidence that people tend to change their intentions towards health behaviour when the persuasion message is linked to their mental state. Thus, this study explores this link by introducing an explainable VA that provides explanation according to the user's mental state (beliefs and goals) rather than the agent's mental state as commonly utilised in explainable agents. It further explores the influence of different explanation patterns that refer to beliefs, goals, or beliefs&goals on the user's behaviour change. An explainable VA was designed to advise undergraduate students how to manage their study-related stress by motivating them to change certain behaviours. With 91 participants, the VA was evaluated and the results revealed that user-specific explanation could significantly encourage behaviour change intentions and build good user-agent relationship. Small differences were found between the three types of explanation patterns.","author":[{"family":"Abdulrahman","given":"Amal"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Bilgin","given":"Ayse Aysin"}],"citation-key":"abdulrahmanExploringInfluenceUserspecific2022","container-title":"Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems","container-title-short":"Auton Agent Multi Agent Syst","DOI":"10.1007/s10458-022-09553-x","ISSN":"1387-2532","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"25","PMCID":"PMC8977831","PMID":"35401031","source":"PubMed","title":"Exploring the influence of a user-specific explainable virtual advisor on health behaviour change intentions","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"aisbittEditorialPerspectiveDigital2023","abstract":"COVID-19 has triggered a shift towards remote delivery of therapy and, despite a number of benefits, it risks discriminating against young people already marginalised due to adverse early life experiences, poverty or ethnicity. This editorial perspective considers challenges for remote therapy, focusing on: the financial burden of telehealth; the necessity of safety to speak; and, how telehealth may exacerbate difficulties in therapeutic alliance formation by interfering with epistemic trust and mentalising. As well as compounding the inaccessibility for children who are subject to abuse, the implicit assumptions behind telehealth risk disproportionately excluding from therapy those from a low socioeconomic status, and who are from ethnic minorities. Suggestions are made for how these challenges may be addressed. It is argued that service design and delivery should seek to proceed with the practicalities and principles of engagement in mind and use this as an opportunity to improve parity of access, rather than risk further entrenching inequalities.","author":[{"family":"Aisbitt","given":"Georgina M."},{"family":"Nolte","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Fonagy","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"aisbittEditorialPerspectiveDigital2023","container-title":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health","container-title-short":"Child Adolesc Ment Health","DOI":"10.1111/camh.12545","ISSN":"1475-357X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"105-107","PMID":"35179284","source":"PubMed","title":"Editorial Perspective: The digital divide - inequalities in remote therapy for children and adolescents","title-short":"Editorial Perspective","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"albanoRelationshipWorkingAlliance2021","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The quality of working alliance (WA) is associated with treatment outcomes across several types of psychiatric disorders and psychological interventions. This study examined the role of WA with peer mentors (people with lived experience of illness) and student mentors (graduated psychology students) in a 6-week, digital, guided self-help (GSH) intervention for anorexia nervosa.\nMETHOD: Ninety-nine patients rated weekly, for 6 weeks: (a) eating psychopathology using the short version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-QS) and (b) WA with a student mentor (n = 14) or a peer mentor (n = 10). WA was assessed by asking patients the extent to which they felt comfortable working with their mentor and the extent to which they agreed with them on the goals for support. WA with mentors and the association with eating psychopathology change were measured on a session-by-session basis. The analysis involved a random intercepts cross-lagged panel model.\nRESULTS: WA with peer mentors was slightly higher than WA with students (ES = 0.3). Peer mentors' WA in the previous session was significantly associated with eating psychopathology ratings in the next session. No significant relationship was found between the previous session's EDE-QS scores and peer mentor alliance in the following session. In the student mentor group, there were no session-by-session associations between WA and eating psychopathology. However, greater WA with the student mentor across sessions was associated with less eating psychopathology.\nDISCUSSION: These findings suggest that clinical outcomes are in part associated with the characteristics of the mentor delivering guidance in an online GSH for eating disorders.","author":[{"family":"Albano","given":"Gaia"},{"family":"Cardi","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Kivlighan","given":"Dennis M."},{"family":"Ambwani","given":"Suman"},{"family":"Treasure","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Lo Coco","given":"Gianluca"}],"citation-key":"albanoRelationshipWorkingAlliance2021","container-title":"The International Journal of Eating Disorders","container-title-short":"Int J Eat Disord","DOI":"10.1002/eat.23559","ISSN":"1098-108X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"1519-1526","PMCID":"PMC8453826","PMID":"34042206","source":"PubMed","title":"The relationship between working alliance with peer mentors and eating psychopathology in a digital 6-week guided self-help intervention for anorexia nervosa","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},
  {"id":"albertPsychoanalyticallyInformedMDMAassisted2025","abstract":"Pathological narcissism (PN) is a complex, treatment-resistant disorder characterized by unstable self-esteem that fluctuates between grandiosity and vulnerability, complicating the formation of a stable self-image. With few empirically supported therapies, treatment has traditionally relied on long-term psychoanalytic approaches, but these often face high attrition. Recent research suggests a potential therapeutic synergy between psychedelics and psychoanalytic therapy, offering a novel approach to addressing entrenched personality structures. Studies on MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a compound known for enhancing empathy, trust, and social interactions, demonstrate potential to reopen critical periods for social learning in adults, offering the possibility of therapeutic benefits for conditions with core issues in relatedness, such as PN. MDMA promotes psychological flexibility and openness, allowing for deeper self-exploration and strengthening the observing ego, considered in psychoanalytic therapy to be an essential component for recognizing and modifying maladaptive patterns. By reducing fear-based avoidance in the brain, MDMA facilitates access to unconscious emotions, helping individuals process overwhelming feelings linked to early relational trauma commonly seen in PN. Additionally, MDMA's capacity to enhance compassion and empathy can fortify the therapeutic alliance, increasing its potential to facilitate relational change. This paper presents an MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) tailored for narcissistic patients which is currently being conducted as an investigator-initiated trial (IIT). It explores the model's theoretical foundations, mechanisms of change, treatment framework, and clinical challenges. Combining MDMA with an evidence-based depth therapy like psychoanalytic psychotherapy may offer an innovative treatment for conditions associated with attachment and developmental trauma, particularly personality disorders. While the role of psychotherapy in psychedelic treatments remains a topic of debate, with some proposing psychedelics be administered without psychotherapy, we assert that individuals with early relational trauma stand the most to gain from an integrated psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) model, where MDMA enhances the therapeutic alliance and emotional openness while psychoanalytic interventions provide the structure for lasting change.","author":[{"family":"Albert","given":"Alexa E."},{"family":"Back","given":"Anthony L."}],"citation-key":"albertPsychoanalyticallyInformedMDMAassisted2025","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1529427","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1529427","PMCID":"PMC12006724","PMID":"40256160","source":"PubMed","title":"Psychoanalytically informed MDMA-assisted therapy for pathological narcissism: a novel theoretical approach","title-short":"Psychoanalytically informed MDMA-assisted therapy for pathological narcissism","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"alfonsoClinicalImplicationsCountertransference2023","abstract":"The author provides a historical overview of the psychodynamics of addiction with particular emphasis on countertransference awareness and its relationship with treatment outcomes and prognosis. Countertransferences that frequently occur in the treatment of substance use disorders include shared helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, anxiety, fear, anger, rage, shame, and guilt. These emotional states in clinicians may lead to fatigue, avoidance, and acting out unless therapists are able to ground themselves and disidentify with the projected affective states. Positive emotions may lead to excessive enthusiasm in clinicians and deflect from the therapeutic process, resulting in deviation from established practice guidelines. Coexisting negative and positive affective states may lead to rescue fantasies and transgressions of boundaries. Contemporary psychodynamic clinicians appreciate the quantitative aspect of emotional reactions, where countertransferences accumulate exponentially over time, causing allostatic overload and compassion fatigue. Unanalyzed negative countertransferences are linked to either clinical avoidance or aggression, resulting in withdrawing care, failure of empathy, and dissolution or fragmentation of the therapeutic alliance. The negativism associated with the treatment of addictions may be rooted in unanalyzed countertransferences and psychosocial factors such as internalized negative societal attitudes and stigma. Degrading and dehumanizing attitudes toward people with substance use disorders could stem from internalized negative societal constructs against disenfranchised, minoritized, and stigmatized persons. This editorial introduces the work of Bernardine Han, an addiction psychiatrist who utilizes psychodynamic concepts to guide interventions with people with substance use disorders.","author":[{"family":"Alfonso","given":"César A."}],"citation-key":"alfonsoClinicalImplicationsCountertransference2023","container-title":"Psychodynamic Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Psychodyn Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1521/pdps.2023.51.2.133","ISSN":"2162-2604","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"133-140","PMID":"37260240","source":"PubMed","title":"Clinical Implications of Countertransference in the Treatment of Addictions","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

However, internet-based interventions for older adults with depression are scarce, and little is known about their feasibility and effectiveness.\nOBJECTIVE: To present the design of 2 studies aiming to assess the feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment for older adults with depression. We will assess the feasibility of an online, guided version of the Moodbuster platform among depressed older adults from the general population as well as the feasibility of a blended format (combining integrated face-to-face sessions and internet-based modules) in a specialized mental health care outpatient clinic.\nMETHODS: A single-group, pretest-posttest design will be applied in both settings. The primary outcome of the studies will be feasibility in terms of (1) acceptance and satisfaction (measured with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8), (2) usability (measured with the System Usability Scale), and (3) engagement (measured with the Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale). Secondary outcomes include (1) the severity of depressive symptoms (measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale), (2) participant and therapist experience with the digital technology (measured with qualitative interviews), (3) the working alliance between patients and practitioners (from both perspectives; measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised questionnaire), (4) the technical alliance between patients and the platform (measured with the Working Alliance Inventory for Online Interventions-Short Form questionnaire), and (5) uptake, in terms of attempted and completed modules. A total of 30 older adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score between 5 and 11) will be recruited from the general population. A total of 15 older adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score between 8 and 15) will be recruited from a specialized mental health care outpatient clinic. A mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative analyses will be adopted. Both the primary and secondary outcomes will be further explored with individual semistructured interviews and synthesized descriptively.

Digital mental health (dMH) interventions increase accessibility to evidence-based psychological services delivered in a variety of web-based formats (eg, self-help and therapist-assisted interventions). Robust and rigorous studies of adaptive web-based intervention designs are scarce. No identified randomized clinical trial has investigated the efficacy of a 2-stage adaptive design, whereby the program-only condition or no support dMH treatment program is augmented by either low or high therapist assistance, if a participant does not improve or engage in the program-only condition.\nOBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess whether low or high therapist-assisted support delivered via video chat is more effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms compared with a dMH program-only condition. The secondary objective is to evaluate the role of motivation; self-efficacy; and preferences in participant engagement, adherence, and clinical outcomes (anxiety and depression symptoms) among the 3 treatment conditions (program only, low-intensity therapist assistance, and high-intensity therapist assistance). A mixed methods analysis of factors affecting participant attrition, participant reasons for nonengagement and withdrawal, and therapist training and implementation of dMH interventions will be completed. Qualitative data regarding participant and therapist experiences and satisfaction with video chat assessment and treatment will also be analyzed.\nMETHODS: Australian adults (N=137) with symptoms or a diagnosis of anxiety or depression will be screened for eligibility and given access to the 8-module Life Flex dMH treatment program. On day 15, participants who meet the augmentation criteria will be stepped up via block randomization to receive therapist assistance delivered via video chat for either 10 minutes (low intensity) or 50 minutes (high intensity) per week. This adaptive trial will implement a mixed methods design, with outcomes assessed before the intervention (week 0), during the intervention (weeks 3 and 6), after the intervention (week 9), and at the 3-month follow-up (week 21).\nRESULTS: The primary outcome measures are for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).

  {"id":"aragonaUtilisingNarrativeMedicine2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Despite an improved understanding of its pathogenesis, dry eye disease (DED) remains relatively underestimated and its treatment challenging. A better alignment between the clinical evaluation and the patient self-assessment also requires capturing the whole patient experience of DED. This project aimed to unveil this experience through narrative medicine (NM).\nMETHODS: The project involved 38 expert centres in Italy and one in San Marino, targeting adult patients with DED, their informal caregivers and their treating ophthalmologists. Written narratives and sociodemographic and quality of life (QoL)-related data were anonymously collected through the project's webpage. Narratives were analysed through MAXQDA (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany), NM classifications and content analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 171 patients with DED, 37 informal caregivers and 81 ophthalmologists participated in the research. DED was defined as a disabling condition by 19% of patients and 35% of caregivers; 70% of patients reported that a therapeutic alliance is an integral part of DED treatment and 32% hope for more effective therapies. Forty-four per cent of patients assessed their own QoL as good; however, DED emerged as importantly impacting work performance and social events. DED physical, emotional and economic burden and the cruciality of a trusting care relationship represent the main themes that emerged across all narratives, while empathy and effective treatment are among the factors favouring coping with DED.\nCONCLUSION: This project marked a pioneering initiative investigating the lived experience of patients with DED through NM, simultaneously involving all viewpoints involved in the care pathway. NM enabled the unveiling of factors favouring the ability to cope with DED and its associated QoL implications and provided valuable insights to improve the therapeutic alliance.","author":[{"family":"Aragona","given":"Pasquale"},{"family":"Barabino","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Akbas","given":"Ertugrul"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Landini","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Marini","given":"Maria G."},{"family":"Fiorencis","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Cappuccio","given":"Antonietta"},{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Vercesi","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Frisina","given":"Rino"},{"family":"Bandello","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Berchicci","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Aragona","given":"Emanuela"},{"family":"Semeraro","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Romano","given":"Vito"},{"family":"Di Carlo","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Reibaldi","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Ghilardi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"De Cillà","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Marchini","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Tognetto","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Versura","given":"Piera"},{"family":"D'Eliseo","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Mularoni","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Cagini","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Mencucci","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Coassin","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Di Zazzo","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Rizzo","given":"Stanislao"},{"family":"Fasciani","given":"Romina"},{"family":"Gualdi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Cusumano","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Spadea","given":"Leopoldo"},{"family":"Cantera","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Scorcia","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Giannaccare","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Rosa","given":"Pasquale"},{"family":"Troisi","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Provenzano","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Simonelli","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Marullo","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Ciracì","given":"Lorenza"},{"family":"Costagliola","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Primavera","given":"Vito"},{"family":"Gagliano","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Pinna","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Giovanni","given":"Alessio"},{"family":"Boscia","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Gelso","given":"Aldo"},{"family":"Mastropasqua","given":"Leonardo"},{"family":"Bonfiglio","given":"Enza"},{"family":"Rolando","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Bonini","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"aragonaUtilisingNarrativeMedicine2024","container-title":"Ophthalmology and Therapy","container-title-short":"Ophthalmol Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s40123-024-01033-7","ISSN":"2193-8245","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"2965-2984","PMCID":"PMC11493873","PMID":"39340633","source":"PubMed","title":"Utilising Narrative Medicine to Identify Key Factors Affecting Quality of Life in Dry Eye Disease: An Italian Multicentre Study","title-short":"Utilising Narrative Medicine to Identify Key Factors Affecting Quality of Life in Dry Eye Disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"arnfredGroupCognitiveBehavioural2022","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders have a high lifetime prevalence, early-onset and long duration or chronicity. Exposure therapy is considered one of the most effective elements in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety, but in vivo exposure can be challenging to access and control, and is sometimes rejected by patients because they consider it too aversive. Virtual reality allows flexible and controlled exposure to challenging situations in an immersive and protected environment.\nAIM: The SoREAL-trial aims to investigate the effect of group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-in vivo) versus group CBT with virtual reality exposure (CBT-in virtuo) for patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and/or agoraphobia, in mixed groups.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is an investigator-initiated randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group and superiority-designed clinical trial. Three hundred two patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and/or agoraphobia will be included from the regional mental health centres of Copenhagen and North Sealand and the Northern Region of Denmark. All patients will be offered a manual-based 14-week cognitive behavioural group treatment programme, including eight sessions with exposure therapy. Therapy groups will be centrally randomised with concealed allocation sequence to either CBT-in virtuo or CBT-in vivo. Patients will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 1-year follow-up by treatment blinded researchers and research assistants. The primary outcome will be diagnosis-specific symptoms measured with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for patients with social anxiety disorder and the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia for patients with agoraphobia. Secondary outcome measures will include depression symptoms, social functioning and patient satisfaction. Exploratory outcomes will be substance and alcohol use, working alliance and quality of life.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the research ethics committee in the Capital Region of Denmark. All results, positive, negative as well as inconclusive, will be published as quickly as possible and still in concordance with Danish law on the protection of confidentially and personal information. Results will be presented at national and international scientific conferences. The trial has obtained approval by the Regional Ethics Committee of Zealand (H-6-2013-015) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (RHP-2014-009-02670). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT03845101. The patients will receive information on the trial both verbally and in written form. Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before inclusion in the trial. The consent form will be scanned and stored in the database system and the physical copy will be destroyed. It is emphasised that participation in the trial is voluntary and that the patient can withdraw his or her consent at any time without consequences for further and continued treatment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03845101.","author":[{"family":"Arnfred","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Bang","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hjorthøj","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Clas Winding"},{"family":"Stengaard Moeller","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Hvenegaard","given":"Morten"},{"family":"Agerskov","given":"Lone"},{"family":"Krog Gausboel","given":"Ulrik"},{"family":"Soe","given":"Ditte"},{"family":"Wiborg","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Christopher Ian Schøler"},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Merete"}],"citation-key":"arnfredGroupCognitiveBehavioural2022","container-title":"BMJ open","container-title-short":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051147","ISSN":"2044-6055","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"e051147","PMCID":"PMC8811551","PMID":"35110313","source":"PubMed","title":"Group cognitive behavioural therapy with virtual reality exposure versus group cognitive behavioural therapy with in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia: a protocol for a randomised clinical trial","title-short":"Group cognitive behavioural therapy with virtual reality exposure versus group cognitive behavioural therapy with in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"arrigoniExploringRoleTherapeutic2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Person-centred care underscores the therapeutic alliance (TA) as fundamental, fostering positive treatment outcomes through collaborative patient-clinician interactions. Biobehavioural synchrony within the TA, essential for effective care, reflects an adaptive process where organisms align responses during interactions. Enactivism and active inference provide profound insights into human perception, reshaping musculoskeletal care understanding. Touch and verbal communication, integral to the TA, foster synchrony and alignment of personal beliefs.\nAIM: This study aimed to identify the tools used by manual therapists in musculoskeletal care to establish a TA with patients. Furthermore, it endeavours to evaluate the alignment of these strategies with current literature and their correlation with biobehavioural synchrony, enactivism, and the role of touch in active inference.\nMETHODS: The methodology followed rigorous qualitative research principles, particularly Grounded Theory and interpretative-constructivist principles, conducting eleven semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions.\nRESULTS: The core category identified in the study is elucidated as follows: \"Interwoven Connection: The Fabric of Therapeutic Synchrony.\" The interviews unveiled three main categories, each comprising sub-categories: (1) Creating a meaningful dialogue; (2) Promoting active patient participation; (3) Synchronisation.\nCONCLUSION: Fostering meaningful dialogue, patient involvement, and therapeutic synchrony is crucial for a robust therapeutic alliance in musculoskeletal care. This underscores the importance of establishing a deep connection between clinicians and patients, central to effective person-centred care. Clinicians must prioritise two-way communication, empathy, and patient collaboration in defining personalised goals. Emphasizing touch and seeking patient feedback are also pivotal. Further research is needed to explore these elements and their impact.","author":[{"family":"Arrigoni","given":"Aurora"},{"family":"Rossettini","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Palese","given":"Alvisa"},{"family":"Thacker","given":"Mick"},{"family":"Esteves","given":"Jorge E."}],"citation-key":"arrigoniExploringRoleTherapeutic2024","container-title":"Musculoskeletal Science & Practice","container-title-short":"Musculoskelet Sci Pract","DOI":"10.1016/j.msksp.2024.103164","ISSN":"2468-7812","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"103164","PMID":"39151365","source":"PubMed","title":"Exploring the role of therapeutic alliance and biobehavioural synchrony in musculoskeletal care: Insights from a qualitative study","title-short":"Exploring the role of therapeutic alliance and biobehavioural synchrony in musculoskeletal care","type":"article-journal","volume":"73"},
  {"id":"asherDoctorBrotherAchieving2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are gaps in our understanding of how non-specialists, such as lay health workers, can achieve core competencies to deliver psychosocial interventions in low- and middle-income countries.\nMETHODS: We conducted a 12-month mixed-methods study alongside the Rehabilitation Intervention for people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia (RISE) pilot study. We rated a total of 30 role-plays and 55 clinical encounters of ten community-based rehabilitation (CBR) lay workers using an Ethiopian adaptation of the ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors (ENACT) structured observational rating scale. To explore factors influencing competence, six focus group discussions and four in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 CBR workers and two supervisors at three time-points. We conducted a thematic analysis and triangulated the qualitative and quantitative data.\nRESULTS: There were improvements in CBR worker competence throughout the training and 12-month pilot study. Therapeutic alliance competencies (e.g., empathy) saw the earliest improvements. Competencies in personal factors (e.g., substance use) and external factors (e.g., assessing social networks) were initially rated lower, but scores improved during the pilot. Problem-solving and giving advice competencies saw the least improvements overall. Multimodal training, including role-plays, field work and group discussions, contributed to early development of competence. Initial stigma towards CBR participants was reduced through contact. Over time CBR workers occupied dual roles of expert and close friend for the people with schizophrenia in the programme. Competence was sustained through peer supervision, which also supported wellbeing. More intensive specialist supervision was needed.\nCONCLUSION: It is possible to equip lay health workers with the core competencies to deliver a psychosocial intervention for people with schizophrenia in a low-income setting. A prolonged period of work experience is needed to develop advanced skills such as problem-solving. A structured intervention with clear protocols, combined with peer supervision to support wellbeing, is recommended for good quality intervention delivery. Repeated ENACT assessments can feasibly and successfully be used to identify areas needing improvement and to guide on-going training and supervision.","author":[{"family":"Asher","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Birhane","given":"Rahel"},{"family":"Teferra","given":"Solomon"},{"family":"Milkias","given":"Barkot"},{"family":"Worku","given":"Benyam"},{"family":"Habtamu","given":"Alehegn"},{"family":"Kohrt","given":"Brandon A."},{"family":"Hanlon","given":"Charlotte"}],"citation-key":"asherDoctorBrotherAchieving2021","container-title":"PloS One","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0246158","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e0246158","PMCID":"PMC7906313","PMID":"33630893","source":"PubMed","title":"\"Like a doctor, like a brother\": Achieving competence amongst lay health workers delivering community-based rehabilitation for people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia","title-short":"Like a doctor, like a brother","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"ashurAreThereUnique2024","abstract":"Therapeutic alliance (TA) is a well-established predictor of clinical outcomes in traditional psychotherapy. However, its association with outcomes in eHealth interventions has been inconsistent, which might be due to the absence of measurements specifically designed to capture TA in eHealth settings. The eHealth Therapeutic Alliance Inventory (ETAI) incorporates conventional as well as unique eHealth TA subscales, enabling to examine the contribution of new facets of TA beyond traditional concepts. This study investigates the predictive contribution of eHealth TA subscales compared to conventional TA subscales on clinical outcomes and evaluates the concurrent criterion validity of the ETAI. The study was conducted within the framework of a randomized controlled trial involving a 10-week digital parent training program aimed at addressing child disruptive behaviors. Parents were randomly assigned to either an enhanced-quality or a standard-quality program. Parents from 68 families completed the ETAI at five weeks' post-program initiation and at the post-intervention phase. The primary outcome was the improvement in child behavior, measured by the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory. Positive Pearson correlations were found between all ETAI subscales covering unique eHealth TA aspects, measured at the 5-week time-point, and improvement in child behavior at post-intervention (r s ≥ 0.23, p s < 0.03). The conventional TA subscale showed no significant Pearson correlation with improvement in child behavior. When examining the unique contributions of ETAI-subscales to explain the improvement in child behavior, only ETAI-Perceived Emotional Investment subscale was found to have a unique contribution (β = 0.29, p = 0.019). In addition, scores on most ETAI subscales were significantly higher among parents using the enhanced-quality program compared with the standard program (Cohen's d s > 0.48), reinforcing ETAI's criterion validity. The development of TA scales that incorporates unique eHealth TA subscales show initial promise in predicting outcomes. Further research is needed to better understand how different factors of eHealth TA relate to clinical outcomes across diverse clinical targets and programs.","author":[{"family":"Ashur","given":"Ohad"},{"family":"Saar","given":"Chen R."},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Or"},{"family":"Baumel","given":"Amit"}],"citation-key":"ashurAreThereUnique2024","container-title":"Internet Interventions","container-title-short":"Internet Interv","DOI":"10.1016/j.invent.2024.100783","ISSN":"2214-7829","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"100783","PMCID":"PMC11565397","PMID":"39552938","source":"PubMed","title":"Are there unique facets of therapeutic alliance for users of digital mental health interventions?

  {"id":"atikInfluencePatientSatisfaction2025","abstract":"Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT), which involves the use of a digital application to support face-to-face psychotherapy, is increasingly offered to patients with depression amid a growing body of research on its efficacy. However, there is still limited understanding of the factors that influence the efficacy of this novel treatment method. To investigate the effects of potential factors such as patient satisfaction with the received treatment, patients' self-rated working alliance with their therapist, and patients' rating of system usability of the digital application, this secondary analysis study focused on a sample of 66 university students who completed an effective 6-week bCBT program that included weekly sessions with a therapist and access to a digital mental health application. We examined whether those three potential factors predict patients' improvement in depressive symptoms in a bCBT treatment. Patient satisfaction and working alliance are known predictors of treatment success in standard psychotherapy, yet their importance in blended treatment is largely unstudied. System usability is a factor that is frequently addressed while describing digital treatment programs, yet its contribution to the success of treatments has been mostly omitted. All the variables analyzed displayed a significant positive correlation with improvement in depressive symptoms. When taken together, all the factors account for 16.6 % of the variance in the outcome. However, when three variables were added in the backward multiple linear regression with stepwise elimination, only patient satisfaction emerged as a predictor of the outcome. Although there are significant correlations between working alliance and system usability and the improvement of depression in the bCBT program, their lack of predictive power in comparison to patient satisfaction renders the results inconclusive. Future studies could explore the potential contribution of additional variables to the improvement of depressive symptoms.","author":[{"family":"Atik","given":"Ece"},{"family":"Hornstein","given":"Silvan"},{"family":"Reinking","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Schückes","given":"Magnus"}],"citation-key":"atikInfluencePatientSatisfaction2025","container-title":"Internet Interventions","container-title-short":"Internet Interv","DOI":"10.1016/j.invent.2025.100815","ISSN":"2214-7829","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"100815","PMCID":"PMC11880594","PMID":"40046409","source":"PubMed","title":"Influence of patient satisfaction, system usability, and working alliance on depressive symptom improvement in blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT): Secondary analysis of an open trial data","title-short":"Influence of patient satisfaction, system usability, and working alliance on depressive symptom improvement in blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)","type":"article-journal","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"bargerArtificialIntelligenceVs2024","abstract":"The collaborative relationship, or working alliance, between a client and their coach is a well-recognized factor that contributes to the effectiveness of coaching. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) challenges us to explore whether human-to-human relationships can extend to AI, potentially reshaping the future of coaching. Our presumption that the skills of professional human coaches surpass AI in forging effective relationships stands untested - but can we really claim this advantage? The purpose of this study was to examine client perceptions of being coached by a simulated AI coach, who was embodied as a conversational vocal live-motion avatar, compared to client perceptions of partnering with a human coach. The mixed methods randomized controlled trial explored if and how client ratings of working alliance and the coaching process aligned between the two coach types in an alternative treatments design. Both treatment groups identified a personal goal to pursue and had one 60-min session guided by the CLEAR (contract, listen, explore, action, review) coaching model. Quantitative data were captured through surveys and qualitative input was captured through open-ended survey questions and debrief interviews. To sidestep the rapid obsolescence of technology, the study was engineered using the Wizard of Oz approach to facilitate an advanced AI coaching experience, with participants unknowingly interacting with expert human coaches. The aim was to glean insights into client reactions to a future, fully autonomous AI with the capabilities of a human coach. The results showed that participants built similar moderately high levels of working alliance with both coach types, with no significant difference between treatments. Qualitative themes indicated the client's connection with their coach existed within the context of the study wherein the coach was a guide who used a variety of techniques to support the client to plan towards their goal. Overall, participants believed they were engaging with their assigned coach type, while the five professional coaches, acting as confederates, were blinded to their roles. Clients are willing to and appreciate building coaching partnerships with AI, which has both research and practical implications.","author":[{"family":"Barger","given":"Amber S."}],"citation-key":"bargerArtificialIntelligenceVs2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1364054","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1364054","PMCID":"PMC12044884","PMID":"40313368","source":"PubMed","title":"Artificial intelligence vs. human coaches: examining the development of working alliance in a single session","title-short":"Artificial intelligence vs. human coaches","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Patients' and treatment providers' (physicians and therapists) evaluated digital conversation-based consultations as well as the digital delivery of practical exercises. Methods: Digital consultations between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 were identified. Between June and July 2020, patients and treatment providers completed online questionnaires addressing challenges and advantages of their digital consultations. Both groups documented their satisfaction and working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory). In addition, semistructured qualitative interviews with treatment providers were conducted. Findings: A total of 82 online surveys (response rate 47%) about the digital consultations were available for analyses, with 60 patients correctly identifying at least one treatment provider, and 9 interviews were performed. Patients and treatment providers overall evaluated the new setting of digital consultation as feasible and an efficient consultation format. Interestingly, the working alliance was rated as good. Technical problems were mentioned as the main challenge and the delivery of practical exercises in digital consultations was seen more challenging than having digital conversation-based consultations. Conclusion: Digital consultations were established with overall positive evaluations and with a good working alliance between patients and providers. For the delivery of practical exercises it might be required to develop more innovative digital settings to overcome shortcomings of the digital format.

  {"id":"bateFacilitativeInterpersonalSkills2022","abstract":"One of the consistent findings from psychotherapy process research has been the impact of therapist effects on patient change and the therapeutic alliance. The Facilitative Interpersonal Skills (FIS) paradigm is a task in which participants respond to standardized videos of actors playing patients in interpersonally challenging moments as if they were the therapist, which was designed to assess therapist effects. Participants' video recorded responses are coded for eight skills: verbal fluency, emotional expressiveness, warmth/acceptance/ understanding, empathy, persuasiveness, hope/positive expectations, alliance-bond capacity, and rupture-repair responsiveness. Performance-based procedures like the FIS minimize self-report bias and systematically control for client-related variability while maintaining strong clinical relevance. Research has shown that therapist FIS predicts the quality of the therapeutic alliance and outcome in adult psychotherapy. This paper describes the development and first adaptation of the FIS task using child and adolescent patients as the stimuli, and reports findings from a pilot study testing the reliability. The FIS-Child (FIS-C) task was administered to 10 therapists with a range of clinical backgrounds. Participants also completed the original FIS task and self-report measures of their empathy, social skills, and playfulness. Adequate interrater reliability was achieved on the FIS-C. There were no significant differences between participants' ratings on the FIS-C compared to the original FIS, although there were minor differences in the correlations between the FISC and self-report measures compared to the original FIS. Findings support moving forward with utilizing the FIS-C to empirically study therapist effects that may be common factors across treatment models.","author":[{"family":"Bate","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Tsakas","given":"Angelica"}],"citation-key":"bateFacilitativeInterpersonalSkills2022","container-title":"Research in Psychotherapy (Milano)","container-title-short":"Res Psychother","DOI":"10.4081/ripppo.2022.595","ISSN":"2239-8031","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"595","PMCID":"PMC9153756","PMID":"35532023","source":"PubMed","title":"Facilitative interpersonal skills are relevant in child therapy too, so why don't we measure them?","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"bauerResourceBuildingVirtual2021","abstract":"Background: Veterans have higher rates of PTSD and depression compared to the general population and experience substantial functional impairment. Impairment in social functioning has been a significant concern among Veterans, particularly rural Veterans, who have limited access to mental health care and are at risk for social isolation. Objective: A mixed-method study was implemented to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of webSTAIR, a web-based skills training programme, paired with home-based telehealth sessions. It was hypothesized that the programme would lead not only to reductions in PTSD and depression but also to improvements in social functioning. Method: Participants were 80 trauma-exposed Veterans enrolled in rural-serving VHA facilities with clinically elevated symptoms of either PTSD or depression. The study directed substantial outreach efforts to rural women Veterans and those who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST). Results: Significant improvements were obtained with PTSD and depression symptoms as well as in social functioning, emotion regulation, and interpersonal problems at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Ratings of therapeutic alliance were high as were reports of overall satisfaction in the programme. There were no differences by gender or MST status in symptom outcomes or satisfaction. Conclusions: The results support the feasibility and effectiveness of this integrated telehealth web-based skills training programme for both male and female Veterans as well as for those with and without MST. The focus on resource building and improved functioning make this programme of particular interest. Further testing is warranted.","author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Amspoker","given":"Amber B."},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Terri L."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Christie"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Julianna"},{"family":"Shammet","given":"Rayan"},{"family":"Speicher","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Jan A."},{"family":"Cloitre","given":"Marylène"}],"citation-key":"bauerResourceBuildingVirtual2021","container-title":"European Journal of Psychotraumatology","container-title-short":"Eur J Psychotraumatol","DOI":"10.1080/20008198.2020.1860357","ISSN":"2000-8066","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"1860357","PMCID":"PMC8128123","PMID":"34025913","source":"PubMed","title":"A Resource Building Virtual Care Programme: improving symptoms and social functioning among female and male rural veterans","title-short":"A Resource Building Virtual Care Programme","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"baumeisterClinicalCostEffectivenessPSYCHOnlineTHERAPY2021","abstract":"Introduction: Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) and their integration into routine psychotherapy (i.e., blended therapy) can offer a means of complementing psychotherapy in a flexible and resource optimized way. Objective: The present study will evaluate the non-inferiority, cost-effectiveness, and safety of two versions of integrated blended psychotherapy for depression and anxiety compared to standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: A three-armed multicenter cluster-randomized controlled non-inferiority trial will be conducted comparing two implementations of blended psychotherapy (PSYCHOnlineTHERAPYfix/flex) compared to CBT. Seventy-five outpatient psychotherapists with a CBT-license will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each of them is asked to include 12 patients on average with depressive or anxiety disorders resulting in a total sample size of N = 900. All patients receive up to a maximum of 16 psychotherapy sessions, either as routine CBT or alternating with Online self-help sessions (fix: 8/8; flex: 0-16). Assessments will be conducted at patient study inclusion (pre-treatment) and 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks and 12 months post-inclusion. The primary outcome is depression and anxiety severity at 18 weeks post-inclusion (post-treatment) using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes are depression and anxiety remission, treatment response, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, working alliance, psychotherapy adherence, and patient safety. Additionally, several potential moderators and mediators including patient characteristics and attitudes toward the interventions will be examined, complemented by ecological day-to-day digital behavior variables via passive smartphone sensing as part of an integrated smart-sensing sub-study. Data-analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis with additional per-protocol analyses. In addition, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from a societal and a public health care perspective. Additionally, qualitative interviews on acceptance, feasibility, and optimization potential will be conducted and analyzed. Discussion: PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY will provide evidence on blended psychotherapy in one of the largest ever conducted psychotherapy trials. If shown to be non-inferior and cost-effective, PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY has the potential to innovate psychotherapy in the near future by extending the ways of conducting psychotherapy. The rigorous health care services approach will facilitate a timely implementation of blended psychotherapy into standard care.

  {"id":"beattyEvaluatingTherapeuticAlliance2022","abstract":"The present study aims to examine whether users perceive a therapeutic alliance with an AI conversational agent (Wysa) and observe changes in the t'herapeutic alliance over a brief time period. A sample of users who screened positively on the PHQ-4 for anxiety or depression symptoms (N = 1,205) of the digital mental health application (app) Wysa were administered the WAI-SR within 5 days of installing the app and gave a second assessment on the same measure after 3 days (N = 226). The anonymised transcripts of user's conversations with Wysa were also examined through content analysis for unprompted elements of bonding between the user and Wysa (N = 950). Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.64 (SD 0.81) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.98 (SD 0.94). Three days later, the mean WAI-SR score increased to 3.75 (SD 0.80) and the mean bond subscale score increased to 4.05 (SD 0.91). There was no significant difference in the alliance scores between Assessment 1 and Assessment 2.These mean bond subscale scores were found to be comparable to the scores obtained in recent literature on traditional, outpatient-individual CBT, internet CBT and group CBT. Content analysis of the transcripts of user conversations with the CA (Wysa) also revealed elements of bonding such as gratitude, self-disclosed impact, and personification. The user's therapeutic alliance scores improved over time and were comparable to ratings from previous studies on alliance in human-delivered face-to-face psychotherapy with clinical populations. This study provides critical support for the utilization of digital mental health services, based on the evidence of the establishment of an alliance.","author":[{"family":"Beatty","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Tanya"},{"family":"Meheli","given":"Saha"},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Chaitali"}],"citation-key":"beattyEvaluatingTherapeuticAlliance2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Health","container-title-short":"Front Digit Health","DOI":"10.3389/fdgth.2022.847991","ISSN":"2673-253X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"847991","PMCID":"PMC9035685","PMID":"35480848","source":"PubMed","title":"Evaluating the Therapeutic Alliance With a Free-Text CBT Conversational Agent (Wysa): A Mixed-Methods Study","title-short":"Evaluating the Therapeutic Alliance With a Free-Text CBT Conversational Agent (Wysa)","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"begExploringPotentialChallenges2024","abstract":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Psychotherapy remains a fundamental component of mental health treatment, yet it encounters significant barriers to accessibility and efficacy. The integration of digital therapies, encompassing e-Health, m-Health, and artificial intelligence (AI) offers the transformative potential to enhance therapeutic processes through automated systems that improve access and personalize treatment. This integration, however, involves complex considerations, including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the dynamics of the therapeutic alliance. This narrative review synthesizes current literature on the application of digital therapies in psychotherapy, with a focus on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and substance use disorders (SUDs). The review evaluates the effectiveness of these interventions, their impact on HRQoL, therapeutic relationships, and the associated ethical considerations.\nCOLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA: Following Green's checklist for narrative reviews, a systematic literature review was conducted on studies published from January 2009 to May 2024. Inclusion criteria centered on digital therapies, including AI-based, Internet-based, and mobile-based interventions in psychotherapy. A total of 23 studies were analyzed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that digital therapies hold substantial promise for enhancing therapeutic interventions across various mental health disorders, particularly through chatbots and Internet-based psychotherapy. However, successful integration requires careful attention to the therapeutic alliance, HRQoL, and ethical implications. This review highlights the significant potential of digital therapies, including AI-driven psychotherapy, in managing diverse mental health disorders. A balanced approach to integration, prioritizing patient well-being and addressing ethical complexities, is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Beg","given":"Mirza Jahanzeb"},{"family":"Verma","given":"Manish Kumar"}],"citation-key":"begExploringPotentialChallenges2024","container-title":"Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine","container-title-short":"Indian J Psychol Med","DOI":"10.1177/02537176241300569","ISSN":"0253-7176","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"02537176241300569","PMCID":"PMC11645680","PMID":"39677516","source":"PubMed","title":"Exploring the Potential and Challenges of Digital and AI-Driven Psychotherapy for ADHD, OCD, Schizophrenia, and Substance Use Disorders: A Comprehensive Narrative Review","title-short":"Exploring the Potential and Challenges of Digital and AI-Driven Psychotherapy for ADHD, OCD, Schizophrenia, and Substance Use Disorders","type":"article-journal"},

Regression decision tree machine learning analyses were used to build prediction models for each of three aspects of TPT acceptance in a training subset of the data and subsequently tested in the remaining subset of the total sample.\nRESULTS: Attitudes towards TPT were most positive for therapists who reported a neutral or strong online working alliance with their patients, especially if they experienced little professional self-doubt and were younger than 40 years old. Therapists who were most concerned about TPT were those who reported higher levels of professional self-doubt, particularly if they also reported vicarious trauma experiences. Therapists who reported low working alliance with their patients were least likely to use TPT in the future. Performance metrics for the decision trees indicated that these three models held up well in an out-of-sample dataset.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therapists' professional self-doubt and the quality of their working alliance with their online patients appear to be the most pertinent factors associated with therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during COVID-19 and should be addressed in future training and research.","author":[{"family":"Békés","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Aafjes-van Doorn","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Zilcha-Mano","given":"Sigal"},{"family":"Prout","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Leon"}],"citation-key":"bekesPsychotherapistsAcceptanceTelepsychotherapy2021","container-title":"Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1002/cpp.2682","ISSN":"1099-0879","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"1403-1415","PMCID":"PMC8652775","PMID":"34723404","source":"PubMed","title":"Psychotherapists' acceptance of telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A machine learning approach","title-short":"Psychotherapists' acceptance of telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"bekesPsychotherapistsChallengesOnline2021","abstract":"Therapists' forced transition to provide psychotherapy remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to examine therapists' views and challenges with online therapy. This study aimed to investigate the main challenges experienced by therapists during the transition from in-person to online therapy at the beginning of the pandemic and 3 months later, and the association between these challenges and therapists' perception of the quality of the relationship with their online patients, and therapists' attitudes and views about online therapy and its efficacy at these two timepoints. As part of a large-scale international longitudinal survey, we collected data from 1,257 therapists at two timepoints: at the start of COVID-19, when many therapists switched from providing in-person therapy to online therapy, as well as 3 months later, when they had had the opportunity to adjust to the online therapy format. At both timepoints, therapists reported on perceived challenges, quality of working alliance and real relationship, attitudes toward online therapy, and their views on online therapy's efficacy compared to in-person therapy. Factor analysis of individual survey items at both timepoints identified four different types of challenges among this therapist sample: Emotional connection (feeling connected with patients, reading emotions, express or feel empathy), Distraction during sessions (therapist or patient), Patients' privacy (private space, confidentiality), and Therapists' boundaries (professional space, boundary setting). Older and more experienced therapists perceived fewer challenges in their online sessions. At baseline, all four types of challenges were associated with lower perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and more negative attitudes toward online therapy and its efficacy. After 3 months, perceived challenges with three domains - Emotional connection, Patients' privacy, and Therapists' boundaries significantly decreased - whereas challenges in the fourth domain - Distraction - increased. In our study, therapists' concerns about being able to connect with patients online appeared to be the most impactful, in that it predicted negative attitudes toward online therapy and its perceived efficacy 3 months later, above and beyond the effect of therapists' age and clinical experience. Clinical and training implications are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Békés","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Aafjes-van Doorn","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xiaochen"},{"family":"Prout","given":"Tracy A."},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Leon"}],"citation-key":"bekesPsychotherapistsChallengesOnline2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.705699","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"705699","PMCID":"PMC8339462","PMID":"34367030","source":"PubMed","title":"Psychotherapists' Challenges With Online Therapy During COVID-19: Concerns About Connectedness Predict Therapists' Negative View of Online Therapy and Its Perceived Efficacy Over Time","title-short":"Psychotherapists' Challenges With Online Therapy During COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"ben-zeevCombiningMHealthTechnology2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In West Africa, healers greatly outnumber trained mental health professionals. People with serious mental illness (SMI) are often seen by healers in \"prayer camps\" where they may also experience human rights abuses. We developed \"M&M,\" an 8-week-long dual-pronged intervention involving (1) a smartphone-delivered toolkit designed to expose healers to brief psychosocial interventions and encourage them to preserve human rights (M-Healer app), and (2) a visiting nurse who provides medications to their patients (Mobile Nurse).\nOBJECTIVE: We examined the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of the M&M intervention in real-world prayer camp settings.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-arm field trial of M&M with people with SMI and healers at a prayer camp in Ghana. Healers were provided smartphones with M-Healer installed and were trained by practice facilitators to use the digital toolkit. In parallel, a study nurse visited their prayer camp to administer medications to their patients. Clinical assessors administered study measures to participants with SMI at pretreatment (baseline), midtreatment (4 weeks) and post treatment (8 weeks).\nRESULTS: Seventeen participants were enrolled and most (n=15, 88.3%) were retained. Participants had an average age of 44.3 (SD 13.9) years and 59% (n=10) of them were male. Fourteen (82%) participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 2 (18%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Four healers were trained to use M-Healer. On average, they self-initiated app use 31.9 (SD 28.9) times per week. Healers watched an average of 19.1 (SD 21.2) videos, responded to 1.5 (SD 2.4) prompts, and used the app for 5.3 (SD 2.7) days weekly. Pre-post analyses revealed a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in psychiatric symptom severity (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score range 52.3 to 30.9; Brief Symptom Inventory score range 76.4 to 27.9), psychological distress (Talbieh Brief Distress Inventory score range 37.7 to 16.9), shame (Other as Shamer Scale score range 41.9 to 28.5), and stigma (Brief Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale score range 11.8 to 10.3). We recorded a significant reduction in days chained (1.6 to 0.5) and a promising trend for reduction in the days of forced fasting (2.6 to 0.0, P=.06). We did not identify significant pre-post changes in patient-reported working alliance with healers (Working Alliance Inventory), depressive symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), quality of life (Lehman Quality of Life Interview for the Mentally Ill), beliefs about medication (Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire-General Harm subscale), or other human rights abuses. No major side effects, health and safety violations, or serious adverse events occurred over the course of the trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: The M&M intervention proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. Preliminary findings suggest that the M-Healer toolkit may have shifted healers' behaviors at the prayer camp so that they commit fewer human rights abuses.","author":[{"family":"Ben-Zeev","given":"Dror"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Attah","given":"Dzifa A."},{"family":"Obeng","given":"Kwadwo"},{"family":"Beaulieu","given":"Alexa"},{"family":"Asafo","given":"Seth M."},{"family":"Gavi","given":"Jonathan Kuma"},{"family":"Kadakia","given":"Arya"},{"family":"Sottie","given":"Emmanuel Quame"},{"family":"Ohene","given":"Sammy"},{"family":"Kola","given":"Lola"},{"family":"Hallgren","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Pamela Y."},{"family":"Ofori-Atta","given":"Angela"},{"literal":"M-Healer Research Team"}],"citation-key":"ben-zeevCombiningMHealthTechnology2024","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/53096","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e53096","PMCID":"PMC11017829","PMID":"38619212","source":"PubMed","title":"Combining mHealth Technology and Pharmacotherapy to Improve Mental Health Outcomes and Reduce Human Rights Abuses in West Africa: Intervention Field Trial","title-short":"Combining mHealth Technology and Pharmacotherapy to Improve Mental Health Outcomes and Reduce Human Rights Abuses in West Africa","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"benitezConnectionStillMatters2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A strong cooperative bond between the patient and provider (\"therapeutic alliance\") is robustly associated with better alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment outcomes. Although digital treatments for AUD have significant potential, the function of the alliance during digital programs is unclear. We compared the validity of patient-reported measures of the alliance with a digital treatment (\"digital alliance\") for AUD and the alliance with their clinician (\"clinician alliance\").\nMETHODS: We used data from an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy program (CBT4CBT) during outpatient AUD treatment. Treatment conditions included CBT4CBT with minimal clinical monitoring (CBT4CBT + monitor) or with treatment as usual (CBT4CBT + TAU). The digital alliance and clinician alliance were measured with similar versions of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI). The WAI ratings were completed at the 2nd and 6th treatment sessions. A timeline followback calendar assessed daily alcohol use. Bayesian multilevel models compared the strength of the alliances and tested their associations with future alcohol use.\nRESULTS: Data from 43 participants were included (age M = 44; 65% male; 51% Black, 40% White, 9% other; 14% Hispanic). The digital alliance ratings had similar internal reliability as the clinician alliance ratings (ω's > 0.90). Differences between digital alliance and clinician alliance ratings were negligible in both treatment conditions (BF01  = 9 and 31). During treatment, within-person increases in the digital alliance and the clinician alliance predicted modest decreases in future drinking to a similar degree (BF01  = 15). Alliance ratings were not associated with future drinking when posttreatment follow-up drinking data were included (BF10  < 3).\nCONCLUSIONS: The digital alliance with CBT4CBT was comparable to the clinician alliance. The digital alliance and clinician alliance had similar, albeit very small, associations with abstinence during treatment. Future research can explore how the digital alliance develops to improve AUD treatment efficacy.","author":[{"family":"Benitez","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Frankforter","given":"Tami L."},{"family":"Nich","given":"Charla"},{"family":"Kiluk","given":"Brian D."}],"citation-key":"benitezConnectionStillMatters2023","container-title":"Alcohol, Clinical & Experimental Research","container-title-short":"Alcohol Clin Exp Res (Hoboken)","DOI":"10.1111/acer.15199","ISSN":"2993-7175","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"2197-2207","PMCID":"PMC10792249","PMID":"38226756","source":"PubMed","title":"The connection still matters: Therapeutic alliance with digital treatment for alcohol use disorder","title-short":"The connection still matters","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"berkComorbidityMajorDepressive2023","abstract":"Populations with common physical diseases - such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders - experience substantially higher rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) than the general population. On the other hand, people living with MDD have a greater risk for many physical diseases. This high level of comorbidity is associated with worse outcomes, reduced adherence to treatment, increased mortality, and greater health care utilization and costs. Comorbidity can also result in a range of clinical challenges, such as a more complicated therapeutic alliance, issues pertaining to adaptive health behaviors, drug-drug interactions and adverse events induced by medications used for physical and mental disorders. Potential explanations for the high prevalence of the above comorbidity involve shared genetic and biological pathways. These latter include inflammation, the gut microbiome, mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and brain structure and function. Furthermore, MDD and physical diseases have in common several antecedents related to social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status), lifestyle variables (e.g., physical activity, diet, sleep), and stressful live events (e.g., childhood trauma). Pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are effective treatments for comorbid MDD, and the introduction of lifestyle interventions as well as collaborative care models and digital technologies provide promising strategies for improving management. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of the epidemiology of the comorbidity of MDD and specific physical diseases, including prevalence and bidirectional risk; of shared biological pathways potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and common physical diseases; of socio-environmental factors that serve as both shared risk and protective factors; and of management of MDD and physical diseases, including prevention and treatment. We conclude with future directions and emerging research related to optimal care of people with comorbid MDD and physical diseases.","author":[{"family":"Berk","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Köhler-Forsberg","given":"Ole"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Penninx","given":"Brenda W.

The level of agreement between the raters-provider and monthly VloV reports-was calculated for treatment variables in patients and their mood state records. For some sub-analysis, patients were divided into two categories, those who have a daily app's use and those who have a weekly or sporadic use.\nRESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar to the statistics of the treatment center data, including the dropout rate; only 15 out of 23 (65.2%) patients completed the 12 weeks of the pilot study. Participants reported daily use of the technology, but only 5.0% searched for health topic information on the web. Patients expressed positive feedback by using the app and found some functional aspects in VloV that contributed to their treatments and self-care as mood scale record, money earned display, sobriety calculator, and treatment skill functions. However, the \"red button\" function, which allows the patient to ask for help, was not found to be of much use. We found a correlation between the frequency app's use and a higher accuracy in the provider register of treatment related to variables. Although working alliance therapeutic scores were mainly high and non-differences were found.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study on a mobile application for SUD developed in our region, and although it is only a preliminary study, it pointed out important lessons about incorporating digital therapeutic tools into mental health treatment in an intensive outpatient treatments (IOT) setting.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Sistema Integrado de Información Sanitaria Argentino (IS004799).","author":[{"family":"Berrio Cuartas","given":"Diana Milena"},{"family":"Cassinelli","given":"Carola"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Luciana Noemi"},{"family":"Pavlovsky","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"berriocuartasAcceptabilityVloVMobile2025","container-title":"Actas Espanolas De Psiquiatria","container-title-short":"Actas Esp Psiquiatr","DOI":"10.62641/aep.v53i2.1701","ISSN":"1578-2735","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"304-314","PMCID":"PMC11898254","PMID":"40071374","source":"PubMed","title":"Acceptability of VloV, a Mobile App Developed in Latin America for People with Substance Use Disorder among an Intensive Outpatient Treatment","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"bijkerLeavingMyComfort2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Many physiotherapists do not feel adequately equipped to address psychosocial risk factors in people with complex pain states. Hence, a biopsychosocial blended intervention (Back2Action) was developed to assist physiotherapists to manage people with persistent spinal pain and coexisting psychosocial risk factors associated with the development or maintenance of persistent pain.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gain insight into the experiences of physiotherapists with this blended psychosocial intervention.\nDESIGN: and methods: This was an interpretative qualitative study with a reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with physiotherapists (N = 15) who delivered Back2Action. The interview started with the grand-tour question: \"What was your experience in using Back2Action?\" Physiotherapist were encouraged to provide examples, and follow-up questions were posed to ensure a deeper understanding could be reached.\nRESULTS: Four themes were constructed: Physiotherapists became increasingly aware of (1) their own implicit expectations, biases and skills, and underlying treatment paradigms, and (2) the implicit expectations from their patients towards them. This led to (3) creating a deeper and stronger therapeutic alliance with the patient, but also (4) an understanding that implementation of a true biopsychosocial intervention - even if offered in a blended form - requires more practice, confidence and resources.\nCONCLUSIONS: Back2Action is considered a valuable treatment to deliver a biopsychosocial intervention in primary care. Considering the high level of knowledge, skills and competency of the participating physiotherapists, the perceived barriers may be more difficult to overcome for more junior physiotherapists.","author":[{"family":"Bijker","given":"L."},{"family":"Scholten-Peeters","given":"G.

TFP is an individual, psychodynamic therapy developed to treat a range of personality disorders. TFP is evidence-based for the treatment of borderline personality disorder and has been adapted for the treatment of NPD. This case illustrates the application of the strategies and techniques of TFP to treatment of NPD as well as challenges clinicians may face in arriving at timely diagnosis of the disorder. Although no specific treatment for NPD has been empirically validated, TFP utilizes the therapeutic techniques identified across modalities for successful treatment of pathological narcissism. This report describes how treatment interventions such as goal setting, developing a therapeutic alliance, using a treatment contract and addressing treatment interfering behaviors contributed to this patient's improvement in self-reflection, formation of healthier and more flexible ideas about self and other, increased self-agency, tolerance of normative disillusionments and increase in empathy.","author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Caligor","given":"Eve"}],"citation-key":"birdCaseReportTreatment2024","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","container-title-short":"J Clin Psychol","DOI":"10.1002/jclp.23637","ISSN":"1097-4679","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"1177-1191","PMID":"38170437","source":"PubMed","title":"A case report of the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder with transference focused psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"bleasePsychotherapyStillFailing2020","abstract":"Compared with mainstream medicine and complementary and alternative therapies, the practice of psychotherapy has enjoyed a relative pass when it comes to ethical evaluation. Therefore, contributions to the, although slowly growing, body of literature on psychotherapy ethics are to be welcomed. In his paper 'Psychotherapy, placebos, and informed consent', Garson Leder takes issue with what he calls the 'go open' project in psychotherapy ethics-the idea that the so-called 'common factors' in therapy should be disclosed to prospective patients. Although Leder does not give a detailed list, the common factors include therapist characteristics (empathy, positive regard, positive expectations that therapy will succeed), patient characteristics (expectations about therapy including its plausibility, confidence in the therapist), and the working alliance (how well both therapist and patient work well together during sessions). He argues that the project advocating disclosure of these factors is flawed on two grounds: (1) that information about common factors is not necessary for informed consent; and (2) clarity about specific mechanisms of change in therapy is consistent with 'many theory-specific forms of psychotherapy'. There are multiple serious problems with Leder's critique of the recent literature, including how he represents the contours of the debate, which I list, and address in this response.","author":[{"family":"Blease","given":"Charlotte"}],"citation-key":"bleasePsychotherapyStillFailing2020","container-title":"Journal of Medical Ethics","container-title-short":"J Med Ethics","DOI":"10.1136/medethics-2020-106865","ISSN":"1473-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,22]]},"language":"eng","page":"medethics-2020-106865","PMID":"32963089","source":"PubMed","title":"Psychotherapy is still failing patients: revisiting informed consent-a response to Garson Leder","title-short":"Psychotherapy is still failing patients","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"blinderFinancialToxicityMonitoring2023","abstract":"PURPOSE: Financial toxicity (FT) affects 20% of cancer survivors and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. No large-scale programs have been implemented to mitigate FT. We evaluated the effect of monthly FT screening as part of a larger patient-reported outcomes (PROs) digital monitoring intervention.\nMETHODS: PRO-TECT (AFT-39) is a cluster-randomized trial of patients undergoing systemic therapy for metastatic cancer. Practices were randomly assigned 1:1 to digital symptom monitoring (PRO practices) or usual care (control practices). Digital monitoring consisted of between-visit online or automated telephone patient surveys about symptoms, functioning, and FT (single-item screening question from Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity) for up to 1 year, with automated alerts sent to practice nurses for concerning survey scores. Clinical team actions in response to alerts were not mandated. The primary outcome of this planned secondary analysis was development or worsening of financial difficulties, assessed via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 financial difficulties measure, at any time compared with baseline. A randomly selected subset of patients and nurses were interviewed about their experiences with the intervention.\nRESULTS: One thousand one hundred ninety-one patients were enrolled (593 PRO; 598 control) at 52 US community oncology practices. Overall, 30.2% of patients treated at practices that received the FT screening intervention developed, or experienced worsening of, financial difficulties, compared with 39.0% treated at control practices (P = .004). Patients and nurses interviewed stated that FT screening identified patients for financial counseling who otherwise would be reluctant to seek, or unaware of the availability of, assistance.\nCONCLUSION: In this report of a secondary outcome from a randomized clinical trial, FT screening as part of routine digital patient monitoring with PROs reduced the development, or worsening, of financial difficulties among patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy.","author":[{"family":"Blinder","given":"Victoria S."},{"family":"Deal","given":"Allison M."},{"family":"Ginos","given":"Brenda"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Dueck","given":"Amylou C."},{"family":"Mazza","given":"Gina L."},{"family":"Henson","given":"Sydney"},{"family":"Carr","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Rogak","given":"Lauren J."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rapperport","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Jonsson","given":"Mattias"},{"family":"Spears","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Cella","given":"David"},{"family":"Gany","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Schrag","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Basch","given":"Ethan"}],"citation-key":"blinderFinancialToxicityMonitoring2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.22.02834","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"29","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"4652-4663","PMCID":"PMC10564309","PMID":"37625107","source":"PubMed","title":"Financial Toxicity Monitoring in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Patient-Reported Outcomes During Cancer Treatment (Alliance AFT-39)","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

When children with SNI are admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), their parents/families may experience elevated stress due to poor communication with clinicians.\nMETHODS: To address this, we created a photo-narrative intervention designed to facilitate parent-clinician communication. The intervention asks parents/families to share 3 photos with captions that inform clinicians about their child's well-being and quality-of-life. The steps include: 1) learning about photo-narratives; 2) deciding on a story; 3) selecting photos; and 4) identifying the broader context. Clinicians receive a companion guide on how to use the photo-narrative. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, N = 40 parent/family caregivers of children with SNI and their child's PICU clinicians will be randomized to receive the photo-narrative intervention or usual care. Participants will complete study surveys at enrollment and the child's PICU discharge; intervention-arm participants will also complete semi-structured interviews at discharge. The primary aim is to describe: 1) feasibility, assessed by the recruitment (approached/enrolled) and completion (intervention completion/intervention-arm) rates; and 2) acceptability (recommend the intervention/intervention-arm). We also will evaluate proof of concept by comparing changes in parent self-reported stress, perceptions of therapeutic alliance, and effects on stigma, resilience, benefit-finding, and respect as well as clinician self-reported empathy and perspective-taking.\nDISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel photo-narrative intervention designed to improve caregiver stress and communication.

  {"id":"bormannPatientPerceivedImpact2024","abstract":"PURPOSE: Telehealth use has grown tremendously since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the benefits of virtual care delivery are numerous, little is known about patient experiences in group treatment settings when members join both virtually and in person with the counselor (a hybrid model). We sought to fill this gap by comparing patient survey data across care delivery models.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with a substance use disorder enrolled at one of seven intensive outpatient (IOP) programs in rural Minnesota voluntarily completed a questionnaire assessing patient satisfaction, perceived therapeutic alliance, group cohesion, and insight gained from treatment. Starting 7/1/2021, groups were either all virtual, all in-person, or a hybrid model. The survey began on 1/1/2022. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tested for differences among treatment groups. Separate models were used for each survey question, where the dependent variable was the survey response, the test of interest being treatment group-type, with covariates of length of stay and age. Model estimates and model-based standard deviations were used to calculate the Cohen's d effect size.\nRESULTS: Survey results from a total of 1037 individuals were included, one survey per respondent. Data was deidentified upon receipt of the survey, preventing specific demographic comparisons. For the hybrid groups, no significant differences were noted with survey responses relative to in-person, with negligible to small effect sizes seen. When comparing virtual to in-person, virtual was rated as significantly worse than in-person on 6 of the 8 questions; effect size estimates exceeded the small effect size cut-off, and the 95% CI exceeded the moderate cut-off.\nCONCLUSION: Creating a group model where patients can attend both virtually and in-person together appears to improve perceived therapeutic alliance, group cohesion, and treatment insight, compared to virtual-only groups, which may have a negative effect relative to in-person.","author":[{"family":"Bormann","given":"Nicholas L."},{"family":"Stoppel","given":"Cindy J."},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Oesterle","given":"Tyler S."}],"citation-key":"bormannPatientPerceivedImpact2024","container-title":"Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation","container-title-short":"Subst Abuse Rehabil","DOI":"10.2147/SAR.S481447","ISSN":"1179-8467","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"223-232","PMCID":"PMC11520710","PMID":"39474206","source":"PubMed","title":"Patient Perceived Impact of Outpatient Group Substance Use Disorder Treatment in a Hybrid Model or Virtual-Only Model Relative to In-Person Delivery","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

The lack of empirical evidence on the impact and effectiveness of CFI use in clarifying people's perspectives, experiences, context, and identity, and in preventing cultural misunderstandings between migrant patients and clinicians, inspired this study. The objective is to examine the effect of the CFI on the strength of therapeutic working alliances, and the potential mediating or moderating role of perceived empathy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted, involving migrant patients, their confidants, and clinicians. The CFI will be administered in the intervention group, but not in the control group. Validated questionnaires will be used to assess therapeutic working alliances and perceived empathy. T-tests and linear regression analyses will be conducted to investigate between-group differences and possible mediating or moderating effects.\nRESULTS: This study will indicate whether or not the CFI strengthens the therapeutic working alliance between patients and clinicians, as moderated and/or mediated by perceived empathy.\nDISCUSSION: Research on the effect and impact of using the CFI in mental health care for migrant patients is important to clarify whether its use strengthens the therapeutic working alliance with clinicians. This can lead to a reduction in cultural misunderstandings and improve mental health care for migrant patients. The results may also be important for the implementation of the CFI as a standard of care.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol was tailored to the needs of patients in collaboration with experts by experience. It was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Tilburg Law School and registered in the Clinical Trials Register under number NCT05788315.

  {"id":"braunAcceptanceEMentalHealth2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite solid evidence supporting the efficacy of electronic mental health (EMH) services, their acceptance among psychotherapists is limited and uptake rates remain low. However, the acceptance of different EMH services has yet barely been examined in future generations of psychotherapists in a differentiated manner. The aims of this study were (1) to elaborate the intention to use various EMH services for different application purposes and (2) to determine predictors of EMH service acceptance among psychotherapists in clinical training (PiT).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Our paper is based on a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey. Respondents were recruited via recognized educational institutions for psychotherapy within Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland between June and July of 2020. The survey contained items on the intention to use different EMH services (i.e., guided and unguided programs, virtual reality, psychotherapy by telephone and videoconference) for various application purposes (i.e., prevention, treatment addition, treatment substitute, aftercare). Potential predictors of EMH service acceptance (e.g., barriers and advantages) were examined based on an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).\nRESULTS: Most of the n = 216 respondents were female (88.4%) and located in Germany (72.2%). General acceptance of EMH was moderate (M = 3.4, SD = 1.12, range 1-5), while acceptance of psychotherapy via videoconference was highest (M = 3.7, SD = 1.15) and acceptance of unguided programs was lowest (M = 2.55, SD = 1.14). There was an interaction effect of EMH service and application purpose (η2 = 0.21). Barriers and advantages both had a uniform influence on EMH service acceptance (Pr > 0.999), while impersonality, legal concerns, concerns about therapeutic alliance, simplified information provision, simplified contact maintenance, time flexibility, and geographic flexibility were significant predictors (all p < 0.05). Results showed that the extended UTAUT model was the best fitting model to predict EMH service acceptance (Pr > 0.999).\nCONCLUSIONS: The intention to use different EMH services varied between application purposes among PiT. To increase acceptance of EMH services and reduce misconceptions, we identified predictors that should be addressed in future acceptance-facilitating interventions when educating PiT.","author":[{"family":"Braun","given":"Pia"},{"family":"Drüge","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Hennemann","given":"Severin"},{"family":"Nitsch","given":"Felix Jan"},{"family":"Staeck","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Apolinário-Hagen","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"braunAcceptanceEMentalHealth2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Health","container-title-short":"Front Digit Health","DOI":"10.3389/fdgth.2022.840869","ISSN":"2673-253X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"840869","PMCID":"PMC8918841","PMID":"35295621","source":"PubMed","title":"Acceptance of E-Mental Health Services for Different Application Purposes Among Psychotherapists in Clinical Training in Germany and Switzerland: Secondary Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Survey","title-short":"Acceptance of E-Mental Health Services for Different Application Purposes Among Psychotherapists in Clinical Training in Germany and Switzerland","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

Addressing this issue requires high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. Conversational chatbots offer a potential solution given the recent advancements in machine learning and large language models. Chatbots can deliver supportive, empathetic behaviors, personalized responses, and timely advice tailored to users' needs that is engaging through therapeutic conversations aimed at creating lasting social-emotional connections. Despite their promise, little is known about the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of chatbots for cigarette smoking cessation. We developed QuitBot, a quit smoking program of two to three-minute conversations covering topics ranging from motivations to quit, setting a quit date, choosing cessation medications, coping with triggers, maintaining abstinence, and recovering from a relapse. QuitBot employs conversational interactions, powered by an expert-curated large language model, allowing users to ask questions and receive personalized guidance on quitting smoking. Here, we report the design and execution of a randomized clinical trial comparing QuitBot (n = 760) against Smokefree TXT (SFT) text messaging program (n = 760), with a 12-month follow-up period. Both interventions include 42-days of content on motivations to quit, skills to cope with triggers, and relapse prevention. The key distinction between QuitBot and SFT is that QuitBot has communication and engagement features. This study aims to determine: whether QuitBot yields higher quit rates than SFT; and whether therapeutic alliance processes and engagement are mechanisms underlying cessation outcomes. Additionally, we will explore whether baseline factors including trust, social support, and demographics, moderate the efficacy of QuitBot.

  {"id":"broadbridgeTherapeuticRelationshipRandomized2025","abstract":"Genetic counselors routinely provide service in many environments, including counseling-type and medical-type rooms; in this study, counseling environments are characterized by office décor that facilitates discussion around a seated table, while medical environments include an exam table and separate seating. Outside of the genetic counseling context, manipulation of the environment can influence client comfort in disclosing personal information, well-being, and overall satisfaction with clinician communication. However, there is little known about how clients experience genetic counseling in one environment versus the other and how that might influence their evaluation of genetic counselor communication. To explore the extent to which the physical environment influences client perceptions, we video recorded two simulated sessions addressing the same genetic counseling topic with two contrasting styles of communication (more and less patient-centered) in front of a greenscreen background. Videos were digitally placed in counseling and medical environments such that the same verbal and nonverbal communication was presented in the two environments, creating a total of four videos (e.g., a 2 × 2 experimental design). Participants (N = 861) were randomly assigned to observe one of the four videos and respond as if they were the client in the video (e.g., as analog clients). Overall, participants rated the less patient-centered communication more favorably (p < 0.05 across variables), contrary to our expectations. Structural equation modeling revealed that perceptions of nonverbal communication mediated the relationship between communication style and perceptions of the counselor's encouragement of participation in the session and the therapeutic bond. Results offer insight into how the physical environment might influence communication in genetic counseling, illustrating new avenues for improving client-counselor communication in this context.","author":[{"family":"Broadbridge","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Roter","given":"Debra L."},{"family":"Persky","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Erby","given":"Lori H."}],"citation-key":"broadbridgeTherapeuticRelationshipRandomized2025","container-title":"Journal of Genetic Counseling","container-title-short":"J Genet Couns","DOI":"10.1002/jgc4.2013","ISSN":"1573-3599","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"e2013","PMCID":"PMC11923929","PMID":"40110643","source":"PubMed","title":"Toward a therapeutic relationship: A randomized control trial of the physical environment and client-centered communication in genetic counseling","title-short":"Toward a therapeutic relationship","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"brotherdaleQualitativeStudyExploring2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions are increasingly used to scale up access to mental health support, yet very few mental health apps are empirically supported, with high attrition rates. The therapeutic alliance between therapists and clients is a key factor in predicting psychological therapy retention and outcomes. Understanding how this concept translates to the digital context, the so-called digital therapeutic alliance (DTA), may help enhance retention and outcomes in digital mental health.\nOBJECTIVES: To explore and conceptualise the DTA with mental health interventions delivered by standalone apps. Specifically: (1) whether people with mental health difficulties form an alliance with mental health apps; (2) what constitutes the DTA; and (3) the similarities and differences across the traditional therapeutic alliance and DTA.\nMETHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 individuals utilising mental health apps. Interview topic examples included rationale for app support, goals around app use and perceived connection. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Five core themes were identified: (1) connection with 'an other'; (2) accessibility; (3) choice and empowerment; (4) goals and expectations: having lower expectations than in-person support; and (5) safe place: non-judgemental, loyalty, trust.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study strengthens support for the concept of the DTA but adds to existing knowledge by suggesting that the DTA needs to be conceived differently to the traditional therapeutic alliance. App developers can enhance alliance by paying particular attention to the use of human voice features, validating statements, personalised interfaces, and multiple options for activities and strategies.","author":[{"family":"Brotherdale","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Bucci","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"brotherdaleQualitativeStudyExploring2024","container-title":"Digital Health","container-title-short":"Digit Health","DOI":"10.1177/20552076241277712","ISSN":"2055-2076","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"20552076241277712","PMCID":"PMC11648025","PMID":"39687527","source":"PubMed","title":"A qualitative study exploring the digital therapeutic alliance with fully automated smartphone apps","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"brouzosTherapeuticFactorsMember2021","abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate members' perceptions of the therapeutic factors during a group intervention that was designed to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of restrictive measures, their satisfaction with the online format of the intervention, and how these are associated with the intervention's outcomes. The participants (N = 44, M age  = 31.93, SD = 8.09) were Greek adults who attended a 2-week, voluntary, online group intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 1 week before and 1 week after implementation, participants completed several questionnaires measuring their demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. One week after the intervention, they also completed two questionnaires evaluating the therapeutic factors and their satisfaction and impressions regarding telemental health counseling. Analyses showed that the most frequently cited therapeutic factor was guidance, followed by acceptance, self-disclosure, universality, and instillation of hope. Therapeutic factors of catharsis, self-disclosure, guidance, self-understanding, vicarious learning, and therapeutic alliance correlated with elements of empathy, resilience, loneliness, positive emotions, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fear of the coronavirus. Satisfaction with the online format of the intervention was associated to universality, elements of empathy, and symptoms of depression. More specifically, member satisfaction was negatively correlated with improvement in personal distress and depression, an unexpected finding that may be attributed to the brief duration of the present intervention. The practical value of the results for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis is discussed.","author":[{"family":"Brouzos","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Vassilopoulos","given":"Stephanos P."},{"family":"Stavrou","given":"Vaia"},{"family":"Baourda","given":"Vasiliki C."},{"family":"Tassi","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Brouzou","given":"Katia Ourania"}],"citation-key":"brouzosTherapeuticFactorsMember2021","container-title":"Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science","container-title-short":"J Technol Behav Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s41347-021-00216-4","ISSN":"2366-5963","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"609-619","PMCID":"PMC8475888","PMID":"34604505","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapeutic Factors and Member Satisfaction in an Online Group Intervention During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"burOptimizingContextSupport2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Internet-based self-help interventions for individuals with depressive symptoms, in which the main component is often a web-based self-help program, have been shown to be efficacious in many controlled trials. However, there are also trials on self-help programs showing no significant effect when delivered in routine care, and some studies report high dropout and low adherence rates. Research suggests that these findings do not emerge primarily due to the specific content of a self-help program. It seems more important how a program is embedded in the context of human and automated support before and during the use of a self-help program.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to better understand the effects of 4 supportive contextual factors on outcomes of and adherence to a web-based self-help program for depressive symptoms. In a factorial experiment, 2 of 4 supportive factors, for which there is evidence for their role on outcomes and adherence, are realized during the intervention-personal guidance and automated email reminders. The other 2 factors are realized before the intervention-a diagnostic interview and a preintervention module aimed at increasing the motivation to use the program with motivational interviewing techniques.\nMETHODS: The study is a full factorial randomized trial. Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score: 5-14) are recruited from the community through the internet and conventional media. All participants receive access to a web-based self-help program based on problem-solving therapy. They are randomized across 4 experimental factors, each reflecting the presence versus absence of a supportive factor (guidance, automated reminders, diagnostic interview, preintervention module) resulting in a 16-condition balanced factorial design. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms at 10 weeks post assessment. Secondary outcomes include adherence to the program, anxiety, stress, health-related quality of life, possible negative effects, and treatment satisfaction. Potential moderators and mediators (eg, treatment expectancy, problem-solving skills, working alliance with the study team) will also be investigated.\nRESULTS: Ethical approval was received on January 20, 2020. The study was initiated in February 2020, and 240 participants have been enrolled in the study as of November 1, 2020. Recruitment for a total of 255 participants is ongoing. Data collection is expected to be completed by May 2021.\nCONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of relevant supportive factors in the dissemination of web-based interventions is necessary to improve outcomes of and adherence to web-based self-help programs. This study may inform health care systems and guide decisions to optimize the implementation context of web-based self-help programs for depressive symptoms.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04318236; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04318236.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/21207.","author":[{"family":"Bur","given":"Oliver Thomas"},{"family":"Krieger","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Moritz","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Jan Philipp"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"burOptimizingContextSupport2021","container-title":"JMIR research protocols","container-title-short":"JMIR Res Protoc","DOI":"10.2196/21207","ISSN":"1929-0748","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"e21207","PMCID":"PMC7886615","PMID":"33528377","source":"PubMed","title":"Optimizing the Context of Support to Improve Outcomes of Internet-Based Self-help in Individuals With Depressive Symptoms: Protocol for a Randomized Factorial Trial","title-short":"Optimizing the Context of Support to Improve Outcomes of Internet-Based Self-help in Individuals With Depressive Symptoms","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"butrynCoachAccessDigital2024","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study experimentally tested whether coach access to participants' digital self-monitoring data improved behavioral weight-loss outcomes.\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 322) received 12 weeks of group-based behavioral weight-loss sessions via videoconference and were instructed to engage in daily self-monitoring of weight, physical activity (PA), and dietary intake. For participants who were randomly assigned to Coach Share ON (n = 161), coaches regularly accessed a web-based portal that displayed data from the participants' scale, PA sensor, and food record.\nRESULTS: Weight loss at 12 weeks was significantly greater in Coach Share ON versus OFF (6.2% vs. 5.3%; p = 0.04). Self-monitoring of PA (98.70% vs. 97.40% of days; p = 0.006) and eating (98.05% vs. 93.51% of days; p = 0.007) was more frequent in Coach Share ON versus OFF. There were no significant differences by condition in PA (p = 0.57), attendance (p = 0.42), working alliance (p = 0.62), or self-monitoring of weight (p = 0.12).

  {"id":"campelloneSafetyUserExperience2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.\nMETHODS: We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.\nRESULTS: In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05948670; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05948670.","author":[{"family":"Campellone","given":"Timothy R."},{"family":"Flom","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Bullard","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Pirner","given":"Maddison C."},{"family":"Pavez","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Morales","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Harper","given":"Devin"},{"family":"Oddy","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Jade"},{"family":"Eaneff","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Forman-Hoffman","given":"Valerie L."},{"family":"Sackett","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Darcy","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"campelloneSafetyUserExperience2025","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/67365","ISSN":"1438-8871","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,23]]},"language":"eng","page":"e67365","PMCID":"PMC12144468","PMID":"40408143","source":"PubMed","title":"Safety and User Experience of a Generative Artificial Intelligence Digital Mental Health Intervention: Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Safety and User Experience of a Generative Artificial Intelligence Digital Mental Health Intervention","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

Semi‑structured interviews to determine patients' perceptions and experiences were recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded independently by two researchers using inductive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Three overarching themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Facilitators for engagement and adherence: Innovative digital tools and personalised guidance foster active participation by providing flexible access and systematic progress monitoring; (2) Barriers to sustained participation: Technological issues, physical limitations and fluctuating motivation serve as critical impediments, underscoring the potential benefits of hybrid intervention models; and (3) Therapeutic alliance as support: A robust, individualised therapeutic relationship enhances patient confidence and self-management, ultimately contributing to sustained empowerment and recovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: A multimodal home-based rehabilitation program with monitoring and personalisation by the physiotherapist is rated positively by post-acute COVID-19 patients, with asynchronous telerehabilitation emerging as the preferred method.

  {"id":"cecon-stabelDoesModeCare2024","abstract":"PURPOSE: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, psycho-oncological care has increasingly been provided virtually and/or telephonically. We examined whether patients' therapeutic alliance (TA) - an essential processual outcome - differs due to altered modes of care delivery (MOCD) and assessed, if MOCD impacts patients' care satisfaction and patient reported outcomes.\nMETHODS: Survey and documentation data from newly diagnosed cancer patients that were cared for in the new form of care 'isPO' in Germany, were analyzed. Patients were surveyed after completing the one-year psycho-oncological care program. MOCD was operationalized by the ratio of patients' face-to-face, telephonic or video-based consultations to all their consultations. Regression analyzes were conducted to determine a possible relationship between MOCD and TA, between MOCD and patients' care satisfaction ('subjective effectiveness' and 'satisfaction and needs-orientation') and patient reported outcomes (anxiety and depression, sense of coherence, global health status).\nFINDINGS: MOCD does not significantly influence TA. Regression models on the possible effect on subjective effectiveness and satisfaction and needs-orientation do not show statistical significance with only MOCD as the predictor. MOCD does not predict any of the patient reported outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, neither TA, care satisfaction nor patient reported outcomes were affected by the MOCD in the new form of care 'isPO'. Therefore, the MOCD didn't negatively affect quality of care, which indicates that telephone or video consultations seem to be useful alternatives for psycho-oncological care in Germany.","author":[{"family":"Cecon-Stabel","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Omairat","given":"Meriam"},{"family":"Salm","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Hagemeier","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Dresen","given":"Antje"},{"family":"Krieger","given":"Theresia"}],"citation-key":"cecon-stabelDoesModeCare2024","container-title":"Journal of Psychosocial Oncology","container-title-short":"J Psychosoc Oncol","DOI":"10.1080/07347332.2024.2318224","ISSN":"1540-7586","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"653-673","PMID":"38483789","source":"PubMed","title":"Does the mode of care delivery affect therapeutic alliance, patient care satisfaction or patient reported outcomes?

The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of a digital narrative diary integrated into the care pathway of patients with bone sarcoma and limb soft tissue sarcoma both from the patients' and the healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perspectives. A digital platform, DNMLAB, was designed to obtain guided narratives from patients during their pathway of care in compliance with confidentiality and data protection laws. The diary was used for patients, often young, facing a rare and impactful disease that is difficult to manage and with few opportunities to share experiences. The multidisciplinary team shared the narratives and integrated them into the patient's treatment pathway. Narrative prompts were adequate for the care pathway. Patients correctly considered the diary as a shared area to think about their condition, and HCPs considered it \"a shared area growing at each meeting with the patient\". The main advantages reported by patients were increased awareness, the opportunity to express their opinion on cures and important personal needs and the perception of better taking charge (score ≥ 4.6). The main advantages of HCP were improved communication, therapeutic alliance, and deeper knowledge of patients.

  {"id":"cerritoTherapyModePreference2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of tele-mental health care increased rapidly in 2020 as a critical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as an effective contact-free alternative to treatment. Today, tele-mental health care remains a viable option for individuals with geographic and physical barriers to treatment. However, there are several potential therapeutic disadvantages to tele-mental health care (ie, missing nonverbal signals, handling crises, confidentiality, weakened social connection in group therapy) that should be evaluated. While published literature has explored client satisfaction within teletherapy and the effect of using technology for tele-mental health care demands, there is a need for published surveys that evaluate the therapeutic experience in teletherapy and in-person mediums of care.\nOBJECTIVE: The authors of this study sought to develop and validate a survey that could evaluate the comparative impact of teletherapy and in-person care from a therapeutic perspective across key factors (ie, therapeutic alliance, engagement, rapport, and confidentiality).\nMETHODS: Participants were clients who experienced both tele-mental health care and in-person therapy at an intensive outpatient mental health treatment program for young adults from April 2020 through June 2022. Generated items on the survey were formulated based on input from experts in the field and existing validated scales. All individuals completed the survey on the internet, following informed consent (n=89). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to understand factor structure, and Cronbach α was used to determine internal consistency. Incremental validity was demonstrated through a hierarchical linear regression.\nRESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis revealed a 14-item, 3-factor structure. All 14 items correlated at a minimum of 0.30 with at least one other item. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.75 and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (χ291=528.41, P<.001). In total, 3 factors accounted for 61% of the variance, and the preliminary Cronbach α (α=0.71) indicates a satisfactory level of internal consistency. The Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale (ZEF) and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ; -0.29) were significantly correlated, as well as the ZEF and Therapy Mode Preference Scale (TMPS; -0.31), and CSQ and TMPS (0.50; P<.001). Hierarchical linear regression revealed that the CSQ significantly accounted for additional variance in the TMPS (P<.001). With the ZEF entered into the model, no further variance was accounted for (P=.06).\nCONCLUSIONS: Continual research is warranted to expand the current findings by validating this standardized tool for assessing the therapeutic impact of teletherapy versus in-person care in a generalizable population.","author":[{"family":"Cerrito","given":"Brianna"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Fialk","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Buono","given":"Frank D."}],"citation-key":"cerritoTherapyModePreference2024","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/65477","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"language":"eng","page":"e65477","PMCID":"PMC11623782","PMID":"39612373","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapy Mode Preference Scale: Preliminary Validation Methodological Design","title-short":"Therapy Mode Preference Scale","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"chiauzziRelationalAgentIntervention2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Unmet pediatric mental health (MH) needs are growing as rates of pediatric depression and anxiety dramatically increase. Access to care is limited by multiple factors, including a shortage of clinicians trained in developmentally specific, evidence-based services. Novel approaches to MH care delivery, including technology-leveraged and readily accessible options, need to be evaluated in service of expanding evidence-based services to youths and their families. Preliminary evidence supports the use of Woebot, a relational agent that digitally delivers guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through a mobile app, for adults with MH concerns. However, no studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of such app-delivered relational agents specifically for adolescents with depression and/or anxiety within an outpatient MH clinic, nor compared them to other MH support services.\nOBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of an investigational device, Woebot for Adolescents (W-GenZD), within an outpatient MH clinic for youths presenting with depression and/or anxiety. The study's secondary aim will compare the clinical outcomes of self-reported depressive symptoms with W-GenZD and a telehealth-delivered CBT-based skills group (CBT-group). Tertiary aims will evaluate additional clinical outcomes and therapeutic alliance between adolescents in W-GenZD and the CBT-group.\nMETHODS: Participants include youths aged 13-17 years with depression and/or anxiety seeking care from an outpatient MH clinic at a children's hospital. Eligible youths will have no recent safety concerns or complex comorbid clinical diagnoses; have no concurrent individual therapy; and, if on medications, are on stable doses, based on clinical screening and as well as study-specific criteria.\nRESULTS: Recruitment began in May 2022. As of December 8, 2022, we have randomized 133 participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Establishing the feasibility and acceptability of W-GenZD within an outpatient MH clinical setting will add to the field's current understanding of the utility and implementation considerations of this MH care service modality. The study will also evaluate the noninferiority of W-GenZD against the CBT-group. Findings may also have implications for patients, families, and providers looking for additional MH support options for adolescents seeking help for their depression and/or anxiety. Such options expand the menu of supports for youths with lower-intensity needs as well as possibly reduce waitlists and optimize clinician deployment toward more severe cases.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05372913; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05372913.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/44940.","author":[{"family":"Chiauzzi","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Athena"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Wells","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Gleason","given":"Mary Margaret"}],"citation-key":"chiauzziRelationalAgentIntervention2023","container-title":"JMIR research protocols","container-title-short":"JMIR Res Protoc","DOI":"10.2196/44940","ISSN":"1929-0748","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"e44940","PMCID":"PMC10024210","PMID":"36867455","source":"PubMed","title":"A Relational Agent Intervention for Adolescents Seeking Mental Health Treatment: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"A Relational Agent Intervention for Adolescents Seeking Mental Health Treatment","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"chiauzziTherapistsOfficeMerging2021","abstract":"This viewpoint focuses on the ways in which digital medicine and measurement-based care can be utilized in tandem to promote better assessment, patient engagement, and an improved quality of psychiatric care. To date, there has been an underutilization of digital measurement in psychiatry, and there is little discussion of the feedback and patient engagement process in digital medicine. Measurement-based care is a recognized evidence-based strategy that engages patients in an understanding of their outcome data. When implemented as designed, providers review the scores and trends in outcome immediately and then provide feedback to their patients. However, the process is typically confined to office visits, which does not provide a complete picture of a patient's progress and functioning. The process is labor intensive, even with digital feedback systems, but the integration of passive metrics obtained through wearables and apps can supplement office-based observations. This enhanced measurement-based care process can provide a picture of real-world patient functioning through passive metrics (activity, sleep, etc.). This can potentially engage patients more in their health data and involve a critically needed therapeutic alliance component in digital medicine.","author":[{"family":"Chiauzzi","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Wicks","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"chiauzziTherapistsOfficeMerging2021","container-title":"Digital Biomarkers","container-title-short":"Digit Biomark","DOI":"10.1159/000517748","ISSN":"2504-110X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"176-182","PMCID":"PMC8460973","PMID":"34723070","source":"PubMed","title":"Beyond the Therapist's Office: Merging Measurement-Based Care and Digital Medicine in the Real World","title-short":"Beyond the Therapist's Office","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"christopherUseKinestheticEmpathy2022","abstract":"Dance/movement therapy is an embodied healing practice which has been found to foster recovery from depression and boost quality of life. Although kinesthetic empathy holds great potential for addressing emotional dysregulation, it is an under-utilized dance/movement therapy intervention in health optimization, especially in adults living with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to collect data from dance/movement therapist on how they use kinesthetic empathy to foster self-regulation in adults living with treatment-resistant depression. A survey design was used to obtain this data. Eight dance/movement therapists (practicing in India, Philippines, Barbados, and the United States of America) were recruited. The participant demographics of the survey challenges the centrality of master's level trained dance/movement therapists primarily practicing in Eurocentric cultures. The survey included open answer questions, and responses received were grouped into four categories: (i) dance/movement therapists' rationale for using kinesthetic empathy (ii) therapist-described client responses to kinesthetic empathy, (iii) changes in self-regulation patterns of clients, and (iv) potential links between employing kinesthetic empathy as an intervention and witnessing emotional regulation in clients. Overall, kinesthetic empathy was described as a core part of the participants' dance/movement therapy practice with this population. The identified client responses to kinesthetic empathy were categorized based on deWitte's et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2021) therapeutic factors of change. 'Observable client responses', such as, use of metaphors, verbalization of body sensations and engaging in mirroring were categorized under specific therapeutic factors of dance/movement therapy. Alternatively, 'emotionally felt client responses' such as, increase in safety and trust within the therapeutic alliance were categorized under both 'specific' and 'mixed-type' factors based on the model. Finally, this article discusses movement interventions that may be incorporated by dance/movement therapists while working with this population. Further research is required to identify the long-term effect/s of kinesthetic empathy as an intentional intervention to foster self-regulation in adults living with treatment-resistant depression.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10465-022-09371-4.","author":[{"family":"Christopher","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Tamplin","given":"Jeanette"}],"citation-key":"christopherUseKinestheticEmpathy2022","container-title":"American Journal of Dance Therapy","container-title-short":"Am J Dance Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s10465-022-09371-4","ISSN":"0146-3721","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"115-142","PMCID":"PMC9510258","PMID":"36187342","source":"PubMed","title":"The Use of Kinesthetic Empathy with Adults Living with Treatment Resistant Depression: A Survey Study","title-short":"The Use of Kinesthetic Empathy with Adults Living with Treatment Resistant Depression","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

Adolescent drinking poses hazards to physical and mental health, amplifies risk associated with other activities typically initiated during this life stage (e.g., driving, sexual activity), and is associated with adverse outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Existing preventative interventions are expensive and have questionable long-term efficacy. Digital interventions may represent an accessible and personalized approach to providing preventative intervention content to youth.\nMETHODS: This study recruited 29 adolescents aged 16-18 (M = 17.24, SD = 0.74) for a pilot feasibility trial of the MobileCoach-Teen (MC-Teen) smartphone app-based intervention. The study team randomized participants to receive either the alcohol intervention (MC-Teen) or attention control pseudo-intervention (MC-Fit). MC-Teen participants received 12 weeks of content adapted from a prior Swiss-based trial of a preventative alcohol intervention. Participants provided qualitative and quantitative feedback at baseline, via six biweekly surveys during and post-intervention.\nRESULTS: Both groups rated the application as easy to download (M = 4.31, SD = 0.93; 5-point Likert). All participants completed the baseline survey in less than the estimated time of 10 min (M = 7:42, SD = 2:15) and rated the survey as easy to complete (M = 4.69, SD = 0.60; 5-point Likert). MC-Teen participants favorably assessed application user experience, message user experience, and digital working alliance with application.

It was hypothesized that Coach5 would be as good as Coach10 in a range of outcomes.\nMETHODS: A total of 202 veterans were enrolled in the study with 101 assigned to Coach5 and 101 to Coach10. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, emotion regulation, interpersonal problems, and social functioning measures were collected pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, and at a 3-month follow-up. Noninferiority analyses were conducted on symptom outcome measures. Comparisons were made of continuous and categorical measures regarding participant and therapist activities.\nRESULTS: Participants reported moderate to severe levels of baseline PTSD, depression, or both. Significant reductions were obtained in all symptom measures posttreatment and at the 3-month follow up. Coach5 was not inferior to Coach10 in any outcome. Therapeutic alliance was at an equivalently high level across the 2 treatment conditions; completion rates and web usage were similar. Total session time was substantially less for the Coach5 therapists than the Coach10 therapists. Both programs were associated with a low, but equal number of therapist activities related to scheduling and crisis or motivational sessions.\nCONCLUSIONS: A blended model delivered with 5 sessions of therapist support was noninferior to 10 sessions in individuals with moderate to severe symptoms. Future studies identifying patient characteristics as moderators of outcomes with high versus low doses of therapist support will help create flexible, technology-based intervention programming.","author":[{"family":"Cloitre","given":"Marylene"},{"family":"Amspoker","given":"Amber Bush"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Terri L."},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Julianna B."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Christie"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Shammet","given":"Rayan"},{"family":"Speicher","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Wassef","given":"Miryam"},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"cloitreComparingRatioTherapist2022","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/33080","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e33080","PMCID":"PMC9096630","PMID":"35475777","source":"PubMed","title":"Comparing the Ratio of Therapist Support to Internet Sessions in a Blended Therapy Delivered to Trauma-Exposed Veterans: Quasi-experimental Comparison Study","title-short":"Comparing the Ratio of Therapist Support to Internet Sessions in a Blended Therapy Delivered to Trauma-Exposed Veterans","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"cohenrodriguesHumanCuesEHealth2024","abstract":"eHealth lifestyle interventions without human support (self-help interventions) are generally less effective, as they suffer from lower adherence levels. To solve this, we investigated whether (1) using a text-based conversational agent (TCA) and applying human cues contribute to a working alliance with the TCA, and whether (2) adding human cues and establishing a positive working alliance increase intervention adherence. Participants (N = 121) followed a TCA-supported app-based physical activity intervention. We manipulated two types of human cues: visual (ie, message appearance) and relational (ie, message content). We employed a 2 (visual cues: yes, no) x 2 (relational cues: yes, no) between-subjects design, resulting in four experimental groups: (1) visual and relational cues, (2) visual cues only, (3) relational cues only, or (4) no human cues. We measured the working alliance with the Working Alliance Inventory Short Revised form and intervention adherence as the number of days participants responded to the TCA's messages. Contrary to expectations, the working alliance was unaffected by using human cues. Working alliance was positively related to adherence (t(78) = 3.606, p = .001). Furthermore, groups who received visual cues showed lower adherence levels compared to those who received relational cues only or no cues (U = 1140.5, z = -3.520, p < .001). We replicated the finding that establishing a working alliance contributes to intervention adherence, independently of the use of human cues in a TCA. However, we were unable to show that adding human cues impacted the working alliance and increased adherence. The results indicate that adding visual cues to a TCA may even negatively affect adherence, possibly because it may create confusion concerning the true nature of the coach, which may prompt unrealistic expectations.","author":[{"family":"Cohen Rodrigues","given":"Talia R."},{"family":"Buisonjé","given":"David R.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Reijnders","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Santhanam","given":"Prabhakaran"},{"family":"Kowatsch","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Breeman","given":"Linda D."},{"family":"Janssen","given":"Veronica R."},{"family":"Kraaijenhagen","given":"Roderik A."},{"family":"Atsma","given":"Douwe E."},{"family":"Evers","given":"Andrea W.

  {"id":"cohenrodriguesUseIntentionUser2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Self-help eHealth interventions provide automated support to change health behaviors without any further human assistance. The main advantage of self-help eHealth interventions is that they have the potential to lower the workload of health care professionals. However, one disadvantage is that they generally have a lower uptake. Possibly, the absence of a relationship with a health care professional (referred to as the working alliance) could lead to negative expectations that hinder the uptake of self-help interventions. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) identifies which expectations predict use intention. As there has been no previous research exploring how expectations affect the adoption of both self-help and human-supported eHealth interventions, this study is the first to investigate the impact of expectations on the uptake of both kinds of eHealth interventions.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigated the intention to use a self-help eHealth intervention compared to a human-supported eHealth intervention and the expectations that moderate this relationship.\nMETHODS: A total of 146 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (human-supported or self-help eHealth interventions). Participants evaluated screenshots of a human-supported or self-help app-based stress intervention. We measured intention to use the intervention-expected working alliance and the UTAUT constructs: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence.\nRESULTS: Use intention did not differ significantly between the 2 conditions (t142=-1.133; P=.26). Performance expectancy (F1,140=69.269; P<.001), effort expectancy (F1,140=3.961; P=.049), social influence (F1,140=90.025; P<.001), and expected working alliance (F1,140=26.435; P<.001) were positively related to use intention regardless of condition. The interaction analysis showed that performance expectancy (F1,140=4.363; P=.04) and effort expectancy (F1,140=4.102; P=.045) more strongly influenced use intention in the self-help condition compared to the human-supported condition.\nCONCLUSIONS: As we found no difference in use intention, our results suggest that we could expect an equal uptake of self-help eHealth interventions and human-supported ones. However, attention should be paid to people who have doubts about the intervention's helpfulness or ease of use. For those people, providing additional human support would be beneficial to ensure uptake. Screening user expectations could help health care professionals optimize self-help eHealth intervention uptake in practice.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF Registries osf.io/n47cz; https://osf.io/n47cz.","author":[{"family":"Cohen Rodrigues","given":"Talia R."},{"family":"Reijnders","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Breeman","given":"Linda D."},{"family":"Janssen","given":"Veronica R."},{"family":"Kraaijenhagen","given":"Roderik A."},{"family":"Atsma","given":"Douwe E."},{"family":"Evers","given":"Andrea Wm"}],"citation-key":"cohenrodriguesUseIntentionUser2024","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/38803","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"e38803","PMCID":"PMC10905349","PMID":"38358784","source":"PubMed","title":"Use Intention and User Expectations of Human-Supported and Self-Help eHealth Interventions: Internet-Based Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Use Intention and User Expectations of Human-Supported and Self-Help eHealth Interventions","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"cullenExposureTherapyVirtual2021","abstract":"Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the current first-line psychological treatment for Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, substantial inter-individual variability exists in treatment outcomes, including inadequate symptom improvements, and notable refusal and attrition rates. These are driven, in part, by impracticalities in simulating intrusive thoughts within clinical settings. Virtual reality (VR) offers the potential of overcoming these limitations in a manner that allows for finely controlled anxiety-provoking scenarios to be created within supportive clinical settings. To validate the potential of VR for treating contamination-based OCD, 22 patients undertook a VR ERP session and a matched session of the current gold-standard of in vivo ERP. In VR, patients were immersed within a contamination environment that permitted flexible delivery of customisable, graded exposure tasks. The VR environment utilised HTC Vive hardware, to allow for patients to both interact with, and physically move through the environment. Subjective and objective measures of distress were recorded, including heart and respiration rates. These measures indicate virtual and in vivo ERP sessions provoke consistent anxiety profiles across an exposure hierarchy. Virtual exposure was advantageous for engagement and adherence to tasks, and the therapeutic alliance was upheld. VR is a promising mechanism for ERP in contamination OCD.","author":[{"family":"Cullen","given":"Alison J."},{"family":"Dowling","given":"Nathan L."},{"family":"Segrave","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Yücel","given":"Murat"}],"citation-key":"cullenExposureTherapyVirtual2021","container-title":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","container-title-short":"J Anxiety Disord","DOI":"10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102404","ISSN":"1873-7897","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"102404","PMID":"33894550","source":"PubMed","title":"Exposure therapy in a virtual environment: Validation in obsessive compulsive disorder","title-short":"Exposure therapy in a virtual environment","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"cunninghamOpeningBlackBox2023","abstract":"The evidence-based treatment (EBT) movement has primarily focused on core intervention content or treatment fidelity and has largely ignored practitioner skills to manage interpersonal process issues that emerge during treatment, especially with difficult-to-treat adolescents (delinquent, substance-using, medical non-adherence) and those of color. A chief complaint of \"real world\" practitioners about manualized treatments is the lack of correspondence between following a manual and managing microsocial interpersonal processes (e.g. negative affect) that arise in treating \"real world clients.\" Although family-based EBTs share core similarities (e.g. focus on family interactions, emphasis on practitioner engagement, family involvement), most of these treatments do not have an evidence base regarding common implementation and treatment process problems that practitioners experience in delivering particular models, especially in mid-treatment when demands on families to change their behavior is greatest in treatment - a lack that characterizes the field as a whole. Failure to effectively address common interpersonal processes with difficult-to-treat families likely undermines treatment fidelity and sustained use of EBTs, treatment outcome, and contributes to treatment dropout and treatment nonadherence. Recent advancements in wearables, sensing technologies, multivariate time-series analyses, and machine learning allow scientists to make significant advancements in the study of psychotherapy processes by looking \"under the skin\" of the provider-client interpersonal interactions that define therapeutic alliance, empathy, and empathic accuracy, along with the predictive validity of these therapy processes (therapeutic alliance, therapist empathy) to treatment outcome. Moreover, assessment of these processes can be extended to develop procedures for training providers to manage difficult interpersonal processes while maintaining a physiological profile that is consistent with astute skills in psychotherapeutic processes. This paper argues for opening the \"black box\" of therapy to advance the science of evidence-based psychotherapy by examining the clinical interior of evidence-based treatments to develop the next generation of audit- and feedback- (i.e., systemic review of professional performance) supervision systems.","author":[{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Phillippe B."},{"family":"Gilmore","given":"Jordon"},{"family":"Naar","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Preston","given":"Stephanie D."},{"family":"Eubanks","given":"Catherine F."},{"family":"Hubig","given":"Nina Christina"},{"family":"McClendon","given":"Jerome"},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Samiran"},{"family":"Ryan-Pettes","given":"Stacy"}],"citation-key":"cunninghamOpeningBlackBox2023","container-title":"Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10567-023-00451-6","ISSN":"1573-2827","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"975-993","PMCID":"PMC10845126","PMID":"37676364","source":"PubMed","title":"Opening the Black Box of Family-Based Treatments: An Artificial Intelligence Framework to Examine Therapeutic Alliance and Therapist Empathy","title-short":"Opening the Black Box of Family-Based Treatments","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

Yet low rates of engagement currently preclude the effectiveness of these apps. One promising solution is to make these apps more responsive and personalized through digital phenotyping methods able to predict symptoms and offer tailored interventions.\nOBJECTIVE: Following our protocol and using the exact model shared in that paper, our primary aim in this study is to assess the prospective validity of mental health symptom prediction using the mindLAMP app through a replication study. We also explored secondary aims around app intervention personalization and correlations of engagement with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scale in the context of automating the study.\nMETHODS: The study was 28 days in duration and followed the published protocol, with participants collecting digital phenotyping data and being offered optional scheduled and algorithm-recommended app interventions. Study compensation was tied to the completion of weekly surveys and was not otherwise tied to engagement or use of the app.\nRESULTS: The data from 67 participants were used in this analysis. The area under the curve values for the symptom prediction model ranged from 0.58 for the UCLA Loneliness Scale to 0.71 for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Engagement with the scheduled app interventions was high, with a study mean of 73%, but few participants engaged with the optional recommended interventions. The perceived utility of the app in the TAM was higher (P=.01) among those completing at least one recommended intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest how digital phenotyping methods can be used to create generalizable models that may help create more personalized and engaging mental health apps.

  {"id":"dalfonsoDigitalTherapeuticAlliance2020","abstract":"The therapeutic alliance (TA), the relationship that develops between a therapist and a client/patient, is a critical factor in the outcome of psychological therapy. As mental health care is increasingly adopting digital technologies and offering therapeutic interventions that may not involve human therapists, the notion of a TA in digital mental health care requires exploration. To date, there has been some incipient work on developing measures to assess the conceptualization of a digital TA for mental health apps. However, the few measures that have been proposed have more or less been derivatives of measures from psychology used to assess the TA in traditional face-to-face therapy. This conceptual paper explores one such instrument that has been proposed in the literature, the Mobile Agnew Relationship Measure, and examines it through a human-computer interaction (HCI) lens. Through this process, we show how theories from HCI can play a role in shaping or generating a more suitable, purpose-built measure of the digital therapeutic alliance (DTA), and we contribute suggestions on how HCI methods and knowledge can be used to foster the DTA in mental health apps.","author":[{"family":"D'Alfonso","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Reeva"},{"family":"Bucci","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Katherine"}],"citation-key":"dalfonsoDigitalTherapeuticAlliance2020","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/21895","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,29]]},"language":"eng","page":"e21895","PMCID":"PMC7803473","PMID":"33372897","source":"PubMed","title":"The Digital Therapeutic Alliance and Human-Computer Interaction","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"dambiImpactWorkingAlliance2023","abstract":"A working alliance (WA) is a multidimensional construct signifying a collaborative relationship between a client and a therapist. Systematic reviews of therapies to treat depression and anxiety, almost exclusively in adults, show WA is essential across psychotherapies. However, there are critical gaps in our understanding of the importance of WA in low-intensity therapies for young people with depression and anxiety. Here, we describe an initiative to explore the effect of WA on anxiety and depression outcomes in youth aged 14-24 years through a scoping review and stakeholders' consultations (N = 32). We analysed 27 studies; most were done in high-income countries and evaluated one-on-one in-person therapies (18/27). The review shows that optimal WA is associated with improvements in: relationships, self-esteem, positive coping strategies, optimism, treatment adherence, and emotional regulation. Young people with lived experience expressed that: a favourable therapy environment, regular meetings, collaborative goal setting and confidentiality were vital in forming and maintaining a functional WA. For a clinician, setting boundaries, maintaining confidentiality, excellent communication skills, being non-judgmental, and empathy were considered essential for facilitating a functional WA. Overall, a functional WA was recognised as an active ingredient in psychotherapies targeting anxiety and depression in young people aged 14-24. Although more research is needed to understand WA's influence in managing anxiety and depression in young people, we recommend routine evaluation of WA. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that promote WA in psychotherapies to optimise the treatment of anxiety and depression in young people.","author":[{"family":"Dambi","given":"Jermaine M."},{"family":"Mavhu","given":"Webster"},{"family":"Beji-Chauke","given":"Rhulani"},{"family":"Kaiyo-Utete","given":"Malinda"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Rhiana"},{"family":"Shumba","given":"Ruvimbo"},{"family":"Muchemwa","given":"Sidney"},{"family":"Musesengwa","given":"Rosemary"},{"family":"Verhey","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Abas","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Hirsch","given":"Colette R."},{"family":"Chibanda","given":"Dixon"}],"citation-key":"dambiImpactWorkingAlliance2023","container-title":"Npj Mental Health Research","container-title-short":"Npj Ment Health Res","DOI":"10.1038/s44184-023-00021-2","ISSN":"2731-4251","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1","PMCID":"PMC9885927","PMID":"37520938","source":"PubMed","title":"The impact of working alliance in managing youth anxiety and depression: a scoping review","title-short":"The impact of working alliance in managing youth anxiety and depression","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"darcyEvidenceHumanLevelBonds2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are far more patients in mental distress than there is time available for mental health professionals to support them. Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews.\nRESULTS: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.","author":[{"family":"Darcy","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Jade"},{"family":"Salinger","given":"David"},{"family":"Wicks","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Athena"}],"citation-key":"darcyEvidenceHumanLevelBonds2021","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/27868","ISSN":"2561-326X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"language":"eng","page":"e27868","PMCID":"PMC8150389","PMID":"33973854","source":"PubMed","title":"Evidence of Human-Level Bonds Established With a Digital Conversational Agent: Cross-sectional, Retrospective Observational Study","title-short":"Evidence of Human-Level Bonds Established With a Digital Conversational Agent","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

This empirical case study was conducted to evaluate test validity, therapeutic alliance, and the clinician's and client's experience of a TA conducted virtually. The validity of test administration was evaluated by experts, who reviewed video of the administration and test results; no concerns regarding integrity and interpretability of the results were identified. Therapeutic alliance, session process, and virtual presence were measured after each session. Both clinician and client reported positive experiences. The overall impact of the TA was evaluated through quantitative assessment of the client's experience and qualitative analysis of interviews.

A health care provider's non-verbal behaviors help build a strong therapeutic alliance, but practice with expert feedback is often required to develop desirable non-verbal behaviors. Advances in technology have been harnessed to assess and provide feedback to health care providers, but the technological tools can be difficult to find and compare. Technology-assisted feedback has the potential to help health care providers hone important clinical skills without requiring highly trained instructors, improving medical care overall.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as review articles. Participants must be health care providers (or students) who routinely conduct appointments with patients. Included studies must incorporate technology-assisted methods that are being used to collect or analyze information regarding at least one behavior associated with the therapeutic alliance in a clinical, research, or educational setting. Any type of patient encounter, whether actual, actor-based, virtual reality, or simulation-based, will be included.\nMETHODS: Five bibliographic databases will be searched, with results limited to English-language articles published from 2010 to the present.

Duration of follow-up was 1 month. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to March 2023.\nEXPOSURE: The PediSICP includes clinician training preceding an ACP communication occasion supported by communication guides and a template for electronic medical record documentation.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes of interest were parent, patient, and clinician experiences with and perceptions of the PediSICP. Feasibility was defined a priori as at least 70% clinician intervention completion rates.\nRESULTS: A total of 10 virtual trainings were conducted among 40 clinicians, including 27 physicians, 7 nurse practitioners, 5 nurses, and 1 respiratory therapist, and 30 trained clinicians (75%) conducted and documented 42 ACP conversations with 33 parents (median [IQR] age, 43 [35-51] years; 25 [76%] female) and 5 AYAs (median [IQR] age, 19 [17-19] years; 3 [60%] female) who completed the intervention. The median (IQR) conversation duration was 27 (10-45) minutes. Most clinicians (29 clinicians [97%]) agreed that they felt prepared for the conversation, and all clinicians recommended the PediSICP. Parents reported participation was worthwhile (27 parents [84%]), they felt listened to (31 parents [94%]), and would recommend the PediSICP (28 parents [85%]). Parents endorsed higher therapeutic alliance after the PediSICP intervention compared with before (The Human Connection scale mean [SD] score, 57.6 [6.4] vs 55.3 [7.8]; P = .03) and decreased anxiety immediately after the intervention (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item mean [SD] score, 10.1 [7.3] vs 8.4 [6.9]; P = .003), which persisted at the 1-month follow-up (mean [SD] score, 7.7 [6.8]; P = .03).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This pilot cohort study found that the PediSICP was feasible, acceptable, and highly valued by clinicians and parents of children with serious illness.

  {"id":"dennisPostpartumDepressionClinical2024","abstract":"Depression during the first year postpartum (postpartum depression) impacts millions of women and their families worldwide. In this narrative review, we provide a summary of postpartum depression, examining the etiology and consequences, pharmacological and psychological treatments, and potential mechanisms of change and current barriers to care. Psychological treatments are effective and preferred by many perinatal patients over medications, but they often remain inaccessible. Key potential mechanisms underlying their effectiveness include treatment variables (e.g., dosage and therapeutic alliance) and patient behaviors (e.g., activation and avoidance and emotional regulation). Among pharmacological treatments, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline is generally the first-line antidepressant medication recommended to women in the postpartum period due to its minimal passage into breastmilk and the corresponding decades of safety data. Importantly, most antidepressant drugs are considered compatible with breastfeeding. Neurosteroids are emerging as an effective treatment for postpartum depression, although currently this treatment is not widely available. Barriers to widespread access to treatment include those that are systematic (e.g., lack of specialist providers), provider-driven (e.g., lack of flexibility in treatment delivery), and patient-driven (e.g., stigma and lack of time for treatment engagement). We propose virtual care, task-sharing to non-specialist treatment providers, and collaborative care models as potential solutions to enhance the reach and scalability of effective treatments to address the growing burden of postpartum depression worldwide and its negative impact on families and society.","author":[{"family":"Dennis","given":"Cindy-Lee"},{"family":"Singla","given":"Daisy R."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Hilary K."},{"family":"Savel","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Crystal T."},{"family":"Grigoriadis","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Vigod","given":"Simone N."}],"citation-key":"dennisPostpartumDepressionClinical2024","container-title":"Drugs","container-title-short":"Drugs","DOI":"10.1007/s40265-024-02038-z","ISSN":"1179-1950","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"645-659","PMID":"38811474","source":"PubMed","title":"Postpartum Depression: A Clinical Review of Impact and Current Treatment Solutions","title-short":"Postpartum Depression","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"dongHowPatientcentredCare2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Due to gender inequities that exist for women of childbearing age, there exists a need to deliver care tailored to their needs and preferences. Patient-centred care (PCC) can be used to meet these needs. This review aims to compare patient care delivery between PCC and obstetrical care. This can help us address how PCC should be delivered to women before, during and after pregnancy versus how it is delivered to patients regardless of sex.\nMETHODS: A review of literature was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for English PCC and high-quality perinatal reviews published between 2010 and 2021. The data were analysed using a modified Walker and Avant framework.\nRESULTS: A total of 2138 unique studies were identified, with 11 PCC and 9 high-quality obstetrical care studies included. Common defining features between PCC and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision-making, therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. PCC-specific features were holistic care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated care and empathy. Unique high-quality obstetrical care themes included continuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and status, physical environment and equitable maternal care.\nCONCLUSIONS: There are shared defining attributes between PCC and obstetrical care, including respect and dignity, informed decision-making, the therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. However, there remain unique defining attributes for high-quality obstetrical care and PCC. This highlights the need for a unique approach to obstetrical care. More research on care for different physiological conditions in women is needed to address patient care that addresses different parts of the lifespan and develop frameworks that can influence health policy, patient care and health system evaluation.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was one part of a larger, multicomponent study of how to implement PCC for women across the lifespan. While we did not specifically consult or involve women in this dual concept analysis, our larger study (content analysis of clinical guidelines and government policies, qualitative interviews with women and clinicians, Delphi study to prioritize consensus recommendations for achieving PCC for women) was guided by the experiences and input of a 50+ women advisory panel.","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Jameel","given":"Bismah"},{"family":"Gagliardi","given":"Anna R."}],"citation-key":"dongHowPatientcentredCare2022","container-title":"Health Expectations: An International Journal of Public Participation in Health Care and Health Policy","container-title-short":"Health Expect","DOI":"10.1111/hex.13434","ISSN":"1369-7625","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"823-839","PMCID":"PMC9122412","PMID":"35026046","source":"PubMed","title":"How is patient-centred care conceptualized in obstetrical health? comparison of themes from concept analyses in obstetrical health- and patient-centred care","title-short":"How is patient-centred care conceptualized in obstetrical health?","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

However, little is understood about how and to what extent a digital mental health program can have an impact on the working alliance and clinical outcomes in a blended (therapist plus digital program) cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) intervention for depression.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the difference in working alliance scores between bCBT and treatment as usual (TAU), examine the association between working alliance and depression severity scores in both arms, and test for an interaction between system usability and working alliance with regard to the association between working alliance and depression scores in bCBT at 3-month assessments.\nMETHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment versus Treatment-as-usual) trial, which compared bCBT with TAU across 9 European countries. Data were collected in primary care and specialized services between April 2015 and December 2017. Eligible participants aged 18 years or older and diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomized to either bCBT (n=476) or TAU (n=467). bCBT consisted of 6-20 sessions of bCBT (involving face-to-face sessions with a therapist and an internet-based program). TAU consisted of usual care for depression. The main outcomes were scores of the working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised-Client [WAI-SR-C]) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3 months after randomization. Other variables included system usability scores (System Usability Scale-Client [SUS-C]) at 3 months and baseline demographic information. Data from baseline and 3-month assessments were analyzed using linear regression models that adjusted for a set of baseline variables.\nRESULTS: Of the 945 included participants, 644 (68.2%) were female, and the mean age was 38.96 years (IQR 38). bCBT was associated with higher composite WAI-SR-C scores compared to TAU (B=5.67, 95% CI 4.48-6.86). There was an inverse association between WAI-SR-C and PHQ-9 in bCBT (B=-0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) and TAU (B=-0.06, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.02), in which as WAI-SR-C scores increased, PHQ-9 scores decreased. Finally, there was a significant interaction between SUS-C and WAI-SR-C with regard to an inverse association between higher WAI-SR-C scores and lower PHQ-9 scores in bCBT (b=-0.030, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01; P=.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that bCBT may enhance the client working alliance when compared to evidence-based routine care for depression that services reported offering. The working alliance in bCBT was also associated with clinical improvements that appear to be enhanced by good program usability. Our findings add further weight to the view that the addition of internet-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT may positively augment experiences of the working alliance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02542891, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02542891; German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006866, https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00006866; Netherlands Trials Register NTR4962, https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/25452; ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT02389660, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02389660; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02361684, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02361684; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02449447, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02449447; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02410616, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02410616; ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN12388725, https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12388725?q=ISRCTN12388725&filters=&sort=&offset=1&totalResults=1&page=1&pageSize=10; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02796573, https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02796573.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1186/s13063-016-1511-1.","author":[{"family":"Doukani","given":"Asmae"},{"family":"Quartagno","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Sera","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Free","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Kakuma","given":"Ritsuko"},{"family":"Riper","given":"Heleen"},{"family":"Kleiboer","given":"Annet"},{"family":"Cerga-Pashoja","given":"Arlinda"},{"family":"Schaik","given":"Anneke","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Botella","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Chevreul","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Matynia","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Krieger","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Hazo","given":"Jean-Baptiste"},{"family":"Draisma","given":"Stasja"},{"family":"Titzler","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Topooco","given":"Naira"},{"family":"Mathiasen","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Vernmark","given":"Kristofer"},{"family":"Urech","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Maj","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Berking","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Baños","given":"Rosa María"},{"family":"Araya","given":"Ricardo"}],"citation-key":"doukaniComparisonWorkingAlliance2024","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/47515","ISSN":"1438-8871","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"language":"eng","page":"e47515","PMCID":"PMC11179025","PMID":"38819882","source":"PubMed","title":"Comparison of the Working Alliance in Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Treatment as Usual for Depression in Europe: Secondary Data Analysis of the E-COMPARED Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Comparison of the Working Alliance in Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Treatment as Usual for Depression in Europe","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"doukaniPractitionersExperienceWorking2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies have been widely acknowledged as a potentially useful resource for increasing mental healthcare access. The working alliance is a key influence on outcomes in conventional psychotherapy, but little is known about therapists' experiences of forming an effective working alliance in blended interventions that involve in-person psychotherapy and a digital programme.\nAIMS: To investigate psychological well-being practitioners' (PWPs') experiences of the working alliance in a trial of blended cognitive-behavioural therapy (b-CBT) for depression. Trial registration ISRCTN12388725.\nMETHOD: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PWPs who delivered b-CBT in a two-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of b-CBT compared with face-to-face CBT. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.\nRESULTS: Participants reported four facilitating factors when building and maintaining a working alliance in b-CBT: having more time to deliver treatment, access to a wider toolkit, capacity to tailor components of b-CBT and receiving appropriate training and support. Participants also identified four barriers to building and maintaining a working alliance: time and resource constraints, usability challenges, limited flexibility to tailor the digital programme to patients' needs and lack of confidence in delivering b-CBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first specifically to investigate practitioners' perceived facilitators and barriers to forming a working alliance in b-CBT for depression. Findings suggest that PWPs' experiences of the working alliance can be improved by: accounting for the time required to deliver b-CBT in service workflows to reduce time pressures; increasing opportunities to tailor the digital programme through offering transdiagnostic tools and adaptable features; and providing appropriate b-CBT training and technical support.","author":[{"family":"Doukani","given":"Asmae"},{"family":"Free","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Araya","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Michelson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Cerga-Pashoja","given":"Arlinda"},{"family":"Kakuma","given":"Ritsuko"}],"citation-key":"doukaniPractitionersExperienceWorking2022","container-title":"BJPsych open","container-title-short":"BJPsych Open","DOI":"10.1192/bjo.2022.546","ISSN":"2056-4724","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,25]]},"language":"eng","page":"e142","PMCID":"PMC9344874","PMID":"35876079","source":"PubMed","title":"Practitioners' experience of the working alliance in a blended cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention for depression: qualitative study of barriers and facilitators","title-short":"Practitioners' experience of the working alliance in a blended cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention for depression","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"dwyerAssessingDigitalPhenotyping2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Low engagement with mental health apps continues to limit their impact. New approaches to help match patients to the right app may increase engagement by ensuring the app they are using is best suited to their mental health needs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to pilot how digital phenotyping, using data from smartphone sensors to infer symptom, behavioral, and functional outcomes, could be used to match people to mental health apps and potentially increase engagement.\nMETHODS: After 1 week of collecting digital phenotyping data with the mindLAMP app (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center), participants were randomly assigned to the digital phenotyping arm, receiving feedback and recommendations based on those data to select 1 of 4 predetermined mental health apps (related to mood, anxiety, sleep, and fitness), or the control arm, selecting the same apps but without any feedback or recommendations. All participants used their selected app for 4 weeks with numerous metrics of engagement recorded, including objective screentime measures, self-reported engagement measures, and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scores.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 participants enrolled in the study; 17 (21%) dropped out of the digital phenotyping arm and 18 (22%) dropped out from the control arm. Across both groups, few participants chose or were recommended the insomnia or fitness app. The majority (39/47, 83%) used a depression or anxiety app. Engagement as measured by objective screen time and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scores were higher in the digital phenotyping arm. There was no correlation between self-reported and objective metrics of app use. Qualitative results highlighted the importance of habit formation in sustained app use.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that digital phenotyping app recommendation is feasible and may increase engagement. This approach is generalizable to other apps beyond the 4 apps selected for use in this pilot, and practical for real-world use given that the study was conducted without any compensation or external incentives that may have biased results. Advances in digital phenotyping will likely make this method of app recommendation more personalized and thus of even greater interest.","author":[{"family":"Dwyer","given":"Bridget"},{"family":"Flathers","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Burns","given":"James"},{"family":"Mikkelson","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Perlmutter","given":"Elana"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Ram","given":"Nanik"},{"family":"Torous","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"dwyerAssessingDigitalPhenotyping2024","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/62725","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"language":"eng","page":"e62725","PMCID":"PMC11615540","PMID":"39560976","source":"PubMed","title":"Assessing Digital Phenotyping for App Recommendations and Sustained Engagement: Cohort Study","title-short":"Assessing Digital Phenotyping for App Recommendations and Sustained Engagement","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"earleMeetingPracticeChallenges2022","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a radical shift in social work practice. Overnight, social work intervention models provided in-person gave way to the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate direct practice in virtual environments (e-therapy). Social work's slow acceptance of e-therapy prior to the pandemic resulted in a lack of training for many social work practitioners and MSW student interns, who were required to make rapid transitions to using and operating in online environments. It appears likely that e-therapy will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, so integrating education about effective e-therapy techniques into social work curricula seems like a logical next step. A social worker's ability to establish the therapeutic alliance, which is at the heart of all helping relationships, will be central to this curricula. Understanding social work students' perceptions of e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance can help shape the development of this new curriculum. Using internal student email, students at two Research I universities were invited to participate in a fully online anonymous survey dealing with attitudes towards e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance. Surveys were conducted in 2018 and April-May 2020. Survey questions were based on the only prior comprehensive study of student attitudes towards e-therapy (Finn in J Soc Work Educ 38(3), 403-419. 10.1080/10437797.2002.10779107, 2002). Study results indicate that students have e-therapy experience, believe that a practitioner can build a good therapeutic alliance, and think that some form of e-therapy will continue after the pandemic. These results confirm that further exploration about the inclusion of e-therapy education and its efficacy in social work curricula requires urgent attention.","author":[{"family":"Earle","given":"Melissa J."},{"family":"Freddolino","given":"Paul P."}],"citation-key":"earleMeetingPracticeChallenges2022","container-title":"Clinical Social Work Journal","container-title-short":"Clin Soc Work J","DOI":"10.1007/s10615-021-00801-3","ISSN":"0091-1674","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"76-85","PMCID":"PMC7925139","PMID":"33678922","source":"PubMed","title":"Meeting the Practice Challenges of COVID-19: MSW Students' Perceptions of E-Therapy and the Therapeutic Alliance","title-short":"Meeting the Practice Challenges of COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

Therefore, it is important to continue with the provision of psychotherapeutic treatment even in times of social distancing. As a result, psychotherapists were soon confronted with the need to expand their traditional treatment setting and offer remote treatment.\nOBJECTIVE: Which digital treatment options are available to psychotherapists since the pandemic, also with respect to the legal regulations? To what extent and how did they use video-based or telephone-based psychotherapy? What is the current stage of research regarding the effectiveness of video(telephony)? How can therapeutic alliance be built into video(telephony) settings? How can psychotherapists successfully apply their personal therapeutic method to different patient groups (children, adolescents, adults) in the new digital setting?\nMETHODS: These questions are answered based on a literature search and clinical considerations.\nRESULTS: The majority of psychotherapists have immediately adapted to remote treatment. This has been supported by the government by expanding existing regulations in order to continue treatment with current and new patients without physical contact during the pandemic crisis.

  {"id":"ellingsenBraintobrainMechanismsUnderlying2023","abstract":"Social interactions such as the patient-clinician encounter can influence pain, but the underlying dynamic interbrain processes are unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamic brain processes supporting social modulation of pain by assessing simultaneous brain activity (fMRI hyperscanning) from chronic pain patients and clinicians during video-based live interaction. Patients received painful and nonpainful pressure stimuli either with a supportive clinician present (Dyadic) or in isolation (Solo). In half of the dyads, clinicians performed a clinical consultation and intake with the patient prior to hyperscanning (Clinical Interaction), which increased self-reported therapeutic alliance. For the other half, patient-clinician hyperscanning was completed without prior clinical interaction (No Interaction). Patients reported lower pain intensity in the Dyadic, relative to the Solo, condition. In Clinical Interaction dyads relative to No Interaction, patients evaluated their clinicians as better able to understand their pain, and clinicians were more accurate when estimating patients' pain levels. In Clinical Interaction dyads, compared to No Interaction, patients showed stronger activation of the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC and vlPFC) and primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas (Dyadic-Solo contrast), and clinicians showed increased dynamic dlPFC concordance with patients' S2 activity during pain. Furthermore, the strength of S2-dlPFC concordance was positively correlated with self-reported therapeutic alliance. These findings support that empathy and supportive care can reduce pain intensity and shed light on the brain processes underpinning social modulation of pain in patient-clinician interactions. Our findings further suggest that clinicians' dlPFC concordance with patients' somatosensory processing during pain can be boosted by increasing therapeutic alliance.","author":[{"family":"Ellingsen","given":"Dan-Mikael"},{"family":"Isenburg","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Changjin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jeungchan"},{"family":"Gerber","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Mawla","given":"Ishtiaq"},{"family":"Sclocco","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Grahl","given":"Arvina"},{"family":"Anzolin","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Robert R."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"John M."},{"family":"Kirsch","given":"Irving"},{"family":"Kaptchuk","given":"Ted J."},{"family":"Napadow","given":"Vitaly"}],"citation-key":"ellingsenBraintobrainMechanismsUnderlying2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2212910120","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e2212910120","PMCID":"PMC10293846","PMID":"37339198","source":"PubMed","title":"Brain-to-brain mechanisms underlying pain empathy and social modulation of pain in the patient-clinician interaction","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},

Although brain correlates of social processes such as empathy and theory of mind have been studied using single-subject designs, specific behavioral and neural mechanisms underpinning the patient-clinician interaction are unknown. Using a two-person interactive design, we simultaneously recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (hyperscanning) in patient-clinician dyads, who interacted via live video, while clinicians treated evoked pain in patients with chronic pain. Our results show that patient analgesia is mediated by patient-clinician nonverbal behavioral mirroring and brain-to-brain concordance in circuitry implicated in theory of mind and social mirroring. Dyad-based analyses showed extensive dynamic coupling of these brain nodes with the partners' brain activity, yet only in dyads with pre-established clinical rapport.

However, the specific elements of patient-clinician communication that may support brain-to-brain concordance and therapeutic alliance are unknown. Here, we investigated how pain-related, directional facial communication between patients and clinicians is associated with brain-to-brain concordance. Patient-clinician dyads interacted in a pain-treatment context, during synchronous assessment of brain activity (fMRI hyperscanning) and online video transfer, enabling face-to-face social interaction. In-scanner videos were used for automated individual facial action unit (AU) time-series extraction. First, an interpretable machine-learning classifier of patients' facial expressions, from an independent fMRI experiment, significantly distinguished moderately painful leg pressure from innocuous pressure stimuli. Next, we estimated neural-network causality of patient-to-clinician directional information flow of facial expressions during clinician-initiated treatment of patients' evoked pain. We identified a leader-follower relationship in which patients predominantly led the facial communication while clinicians responded to patients' expressions. Finally, analyses of dynamic brain-to-brain concordance showed that patients' mid/posterior insular concordance with the clinicians' anterior insula cortex, a region identified in previously published data from this study1, was associated with therapeutic alliance, and self-reported and objective (patient-to-clinician-directed causal influence) markers of negative-affect expressivity. These results suggest a role of patient-clinician concordance of the insula, a social-mirroring and salience-processing brain node, in mediating directional dynamics of pain-directed facial communication during therapeutic encounters.","author":[{"family":"Ellingsen","given":"Dan-Mikael"},{"family":"Duggento","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Isenburg","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Changjin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jeungchan"},{"family":"Gerber","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Mawla","given":"Ishtiaq"},{"family":"Sclocco","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Robert R."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"John M."},{"family":"Kirsch","given":"Irving"},{"family":"Kaptchuk","given":"Ted J."},{"family":"Toschi","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Napadow","given":"Vitaly"}],"citation-key":"ellingsenPatientclinicianBrainConcordance2022","container-title":"Translational Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Transl Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-022-01810-7","ISSN":"2158-3188","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"language":"eng","page":"44","PMCID":"PMC8799700","PMID":"35091536","source":"PubMed","title":"Patient-clinician brain concordance underlies causal dynamics in nonverbal communication and negative affective expressivity","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"ercolePerspectivesTherapeuticAlliance2025","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to conduct a scoping review, which examines research evidence on therapeutic alliance development in adolescents while using telehealth during mental health encounters (telemental health). Thirty-seven percent of all high school students in the United States reported poor mental health during the pandemic, and 44% reported sadness and/or hopelessness in the past year. Therapeutic alliance is a collaborative relationship between patient and provider with a strong affective bond and agreement on treatment tasks and goals. Telehealth may facilitate access, but preliminary research demonstrates provider challenges for building therapeutic alliance during telehealth visits in adolescents. CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ProQuest were searched through June 2023. Inclusion studies examined therapeutic alliance in mental health patients with a mean age of 14 to 18 years and synchronous telehealth use. Articles published in English; publication dates and geographic location were not excluded. A total of 1091 articles were obtained after duplications were discarded. Three reviewers, working in pairs, independently reviewed each citation against predetermined criteria. Joanna Briggs Scoping Review Methodology, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review process organized the findings. The 9 articles that met the criteria were case reports, descriptive, qualitative, mixed methods, and a partially randomized patient preference pilot study. There were 416 adolescent participants (mean age = 15.74 years). Five themes synthesized the findings: \"established relationship prior to telemental health,\" \"diagnoses best suited for telemental health,\" \"role of technology,\" \"therapeutic space and privacy,\" and \"appointment attendance.\" A recommendation emerged in offering a hybrid approach. However, many barriers still exist in the complex, high-risk, and geographically challenged patient. Telemental health can bridge the divide between those who traditionally cannot access treatment, but providers must learn how to develop relationships virtually. Another recommendation is to allow adolescents alone time and privacy with the provider. Further research is needed to assess therapeutic alliance using telehealth between adolescents and clinicians in the postpandemic era, particularly from the adolescents' perspective. Limitations included that three studies occurred before March 2020, when the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic started, and the remaining articles occurred during the pandemic when social distancing measures were in place. Therefore, this limited study methods to single-group designs, and many of the participants already established a relationship with their provider before shifting to telehealth, so there was less focus on the initiation of therapeutic alliance via telehealth.","author":[{"family":"Ercole","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Shea","given":"Kimberly"}],"citation-key":"ercolePerspectivesTherapeuticAlliance2025","container-title":"Computers, informatics, nursing: CIN","container-title-short":"Comput Inform Nurs","DOI":"10.1097/CIN.0000000000001276","ISSN":"1538-9774","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"language":"eng","PMID":"40080654","source":"PubMed","title":"Perspectives of Therapeutic Alliance Using Telemental Health for Adolescents: A Scoping Review","title-short":"Perspectives of Therapeutic Alliance Using Telemental Health for Adolescents","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"ezawaExaminingPredictorsDepression2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, and there is a critical need for effective, affordable, and accessible interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Immersion (CBI) is a novel group-based cognitive behavioral skills training program delivered by lay coaches in the metaverse that can be accessed through various modalities including virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays or flat-screen devices. Combining its ability to offer empirically supported therapy skills in a digital setting that can still facilitate interpersonal variables (eg, working alliance and sense of social support) with the aid of lay coaches, CBI has the potential to help fill this critical need.\nOBJECTIVE: This study had 2 primary aims. First, we aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety symptoms in a sample of individuals who participated in CBI. Second, we aimed to examine 2 interpersonal process variables (working alliance and web-based social support) as predictors of symptom changes. We predicted CBI participants would experience depression and anxiety symptom improvements and that such improvements would be associated with an increase in both interpersonal process variables.\nMETHODS: The study sample consists of 127 participants who endorsed clinical levels of depression or anxiety symptoms during their first CBI session and attended at least 2 sessions. Participants were asked to complete self-report measures of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, alliance, and web-based social support throughout their participation in CBI.\nRESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVAs determined that depression and anxiety symptom scores differed significantly across sessions (Ps<.01). We also found participants' web-based social support predicted improvement in depression symptoms (P=.01), but neither the alliance nor web-based social support predicted change in anxiety symptoms (Ps>.05). We also observed a significant difference in anxiety symptoms between participants who used a VR head-mounted display to access CBI and those who did not, such that participants who used VR head-mounted displays endorsed lower anxiety symptoms than those who did not at nearly every session (P=.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Participation in CBI is associated with both depression and anxiety symptom improvement. Web-based social support may play an important role in fostering changes in depression symptoms. Future studies are encouraged to continue examining the process of change in CBI with special attention paid to methods that can elucidate causal mechanisms of change.","author":[{"family":"Ezawa","given":"Iony D."},{"family":"Hollon","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Noah"}],"citation-key":"ezawaExaminingPredictorsDepression2023","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/42377","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"e42377","PMCID":"PMC10382949","PMID":"37450322","source":"PubMed","title":"Examining Predictors of Depression and Anxiety Symptom Change in Cognitive Behavioral Immersion: Observational Study","title-short":"Examining Predictors of Depression and Anxiety Symptom Change in Cognitive Behavioral Immersion","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"faithMetacognitiveReflectionInsight2023","abstract":"Alternative platform offerings for psychotherapy have become a necessity in the age of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The current study describes the virtual adaptation of Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) for people with psychosis. MERIT is a recovery-oriented psychotherapy that has shown promise in increasing metacognition and allowing individuals to make meaning of their psychiatric challenges and direct their own recovery efforts. MERIT delivery requires the assumption that metacognitive reflection is an intersubjective act where individuals make meaning with others instead of in isolation. As such, considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, research is needed to understand how intersubjectivity and the therapeutic alliance may differ in a virtual environment rather than in-person. The present study addresses this question by illustrating two case examples of MERIT's adaptation to a virtual delivery telehealth format. Moreover, this study expands on Lysaker and colleagues' (2020) investigation of virtual adaptations of MERIT by exploring how MERIT is adapted in a virtual environment, how intersubjectivity changes in a virtual environment, and, what opportunities virtual platforms allow for metacognitive reflection. Overall, we found that MERIT can be successfully delivered in a virtual telehealth platform. We discuss opportunities and considerations for MERIT and other psychotherapy virtual delivery.","author":[{"family":"Faith","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Zou","given":"Denise S."},{"family":"Kukla","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"faithMetacognitiveReflectionInsight2023","container-title":"Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"J Contemp Psychother","DOI":"10.1007/s10879-022-09557-4","ISSN":"0022-0116","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"71-79","PMCID":"PMC9364285","PMID":"35968267","source":"PubMed","title":"Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) Delivered Virtually During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Illustration of Two Cases","title-short":"Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) Delivered Virtually During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"farzanArtificialIntelligencePoweredCognitive2025","abstract":"Objective: This review identifies the characteristic features of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and their therapeutic effect; assesses their efficacy in treatment of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders; and establishes levels of user engagement and satisfaction. Method : Searches were conducted on the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases using a set of keywords such as, not limited to, AI cognitive behavioral therapy (AI CBT), Youper, Wysa, Woebot, and other related terms. We included studies that were empirical, peer-reviewed, conducted between January 2017 and June 2024, and primarily focused on efficacy regarding the interventions and therapeutic outcomes. Data were then extracted and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods concerning the mental health outcome. Results: Our review identified large improvements across the three chatbots in symptoms of mental health, as supported by the 10 included studies: five on Woebot, four on Wysa, and one on Youper. Woebot showed remarkable reductions in depression and anxiety with high user engagement; Wysa demonstrated similar improvements, especially in users with chronic pain or maternal mental health challenges; Youper also presented a significant symptom reduction, including a 48% decrease in depression and a 43% decrease in anxiety. Common benefits of all chatbots were the therapeutic alliance and a high rate of satisfaction among users. We have also discussed the included studies' limitations; that is, study design shortcomings and lack of sample diversity. Conclusion: AI CBT chatbots, including but not limited to Woebot, Wysa, and Youper, are highly promising because of their availability and effectiveness in mental health support. They provide a useful complement to standard therapy when professional help is unavailable, and offer constant engagement with tailored interventions. However, it is necessary that further studies investigate their potential impact as long-term intervention models and explore how they may be integrated into holistic mental health care systems.","author":[{"family":"Farzan","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Ebrahimi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Pourali","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Sabeti","given":"Fatemeh"}],"citation-key":"farzanArtificialIntelligencePoweredCognitive2025","container-title":"Iranian Journal of Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Iran J Psychiatry","DOI":"10.18502/ijps.v20i1.17395","ISSN":"1735-4587","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"102-110","PMCID":"PMC11904749","PMID":"40093525","source":"PubMed","title":"Artificial Intelligence-Powered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Chatbots, a Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"feingoldPredictorsEffectiveTherapy2025","abstract":"Treatment demand for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) has increased in the past decade in almost all European countries, and CUD is currently the most common reason for first-time drug-related treatment admission in the European Union. Even though several therapeutic approaches have been shown to benefit individuals with CUD, there is a lack of knowledge regarding factors associated with effective therapy and the underlying mechanisms of change among individuals with CUD presenting for treatment. The aim of the present paper was to review current knowledge on factors that have been shown to contribute to positive outcomes in CUD treatment. A scoping methodology was used, focusing on empirically evaluated studies that used defined, cannabis-related outcome measures. In eligible studies, factors of investigation were categorized as either 'mediators', i.e., treatment-related factors associated with the processes or mechanisms through which patients benefit from therapy, or 'moderators' which are patient-related characteristics that predict his/her odds to benefit from treatment or patient-related (i.e., moderators). Factors categorized as mediators were then classified 'specific factors' if they were related to a certain technique or treatment modality or 'common factors' if they were assessed beyond treatment modalities. Findings suggest that in CUD treatment, specific mediators include treatment duration, addressing motivation to change, acquiring coping skills, enhancing self-efficacy, and integrating several therapeutic components. Common mediators include therapeutic alliance, empathy, expectations and cultural adaptation. Moderators in CUD treatment include sex, ethnicity, age-related factors and comorbid disorders.","author":[{"family":"Feingold","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tzur Bitan","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Ferri","given":"Marica"},{"family":"Hoch","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"feingoldPredictorsEffectiveTherapy2025","container-title":"European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","DOI":"10.1007/s00406-024-01781-4","ISSN":"1433-8491","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"341-353","PMID":"38493284","source":"PubMed","title":"Predictors of effective therapy among individuals with Cannabis Use Disorder: a review of the literature","title-short":"Predictors of effective therapy among individuals with Cannabis Use Disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"275"},

Focus groups were conducted between December 2021-January 2022, and were recorded and transcribed. Participants were asked about their experience communicating about the COVID-19 vaccine. Themes and subthemes were inductively identified using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: 40 PCPs participated. All PCPs viewed discussing COVID-19 vaccination as high priority. Strategies for promoting COVID-19 vaccination included influencing what people think and feel, building trust and leveraging their relationship with patients, and practical strategies such as on-site vaccination. Most strategies aimed at influencing what people think and feel and leveraging relationships were viewed as generally ineffective. On-site vaccine availability was identified as the most influential factor. PCPs expressed frustration by their interactions with vaccine hesitant patients, leading them to truncate their communication with these patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite using a broad range of strategies, most PCPs were unable to change the strongly held beliefs among the most vaccine hesitant patients that were often informed by misinformation and mistrust.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Promising strategies for promoting vaccination include social/relational (expressing empathy) and practical (on-site COVID-19 vaccine availability).","author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"Kimberly A."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Sonal"},{"family":"Stone","given":"Rosalie Torres"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Ngoc"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Sybil"},{"family":"Mazor","given":"Kathleen M."}],"citation-key":"fisherPrimaryCareProviders2024","container-title":"Patient Education and Counseling","container-title-short":"Patient Educ Couns","DOI":"10.1016/j.pec.2024.108369","ISSN":"1873-5134","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"108369","PMCID":"PMC12015614","PMID":"38996575","source":"PubMed","title":"Primary care providers' views of discussing COVID-19 vaccination with vaccine hesitant patients: A qualitative study","title-short":"Primary care providers' views of discussing COVID-19 vaccination with vaccine hesitant patients","type":"article-journal","volume":"127"},

Patients were assigned to digital intervention or PTAU. Therapeutic alliance was assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion using the working alliance inventory for patients and therapists. Age, usability (system usability scale), satisfaction (visual analogue scale), type and amount of patient-therapist communication were analysed as associated variables.\nRESULTS: Patients and therapists established high therapeutic alliance in the digital intervention, although significantly lower compared with PTAU. The development of patients' therapeutic alliance did not differ between interventions, unlike that of the therapists. No agreement was found between patients' and therapists' therapeutic alliance ratings. Patients' therapeutic alliance was associated with usability and satisfaction with app, whereas therapists' therapeutic alliance was associated with satisfaction with monitoring platform.\nCONCLUSIONS: A stepped digital intervention for cancer patients could develop and maintain strong therapeutic alliance. Neither the type nor amount of communication affected patients' therapeutic alliance, suggesting that flexible and available digital communication fosters a sense of care and connection. The association between usability and satisfaction with digital tools highlights their importance as key therapeutic alliance components in digital settings.","author":[{"family":"Flix-Valle","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Medina","given":"Joan Carles"},{"family":"Souto-Sampera","given":"Arnau"},{"family":"Arizu-Onassis","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Juan-Linares","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Serra-Blasco","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Ciria-Suárez","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Feixas","given":"Guillem"},{"family":"Ochoa-Arnedo","given":"Cristian"}],"citation-key":"flix-valleTherapeuticAllianceStepped2025","container-title":"BJPsych open","container-title-short":"BJPsych Open","DOI":"10.1192/bjo.2024.844","ISSN":"2056-4724","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e23","PMCID":"PMC11822986","PMID":"39865983","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapeutic alliance in a stepped digital psychosocial intervention for breast cancer patients: findings from a multicentre randomised controlled trial","title-short":"Therapeutic alliance in a stepped digital psychosocial intervention for breast cancer patients","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

As the first study to date, the present study examined the feasibility of BraveMind VRET for non-U.S. military veterans. Moreover, the study sought to explore in-depth the participants' experiences with BraveMind VRET. Nine Danish veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after deployment to Afghanistan participated in the study. PTSD, depression, and quality of life were assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 3-month followup. The treatment consisted of 10 BraveMind VRET sessions. Semistructured interviews with treatment completers were conducted post-treatment to ascertain views about the treatment, in general, and the BraveMind VR system in particular. Thematic qualitative analysis was conducted at the semantic level using an inductive approach. There were significant reductions in pre- to post-treatment self-reported PTSD and significant improvements in quality of life. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month followup. Pre- to post-treatment Cohen's d effect sizes were large for self-reported PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version [PCL-C]: d = 1.55). Qualitative results indicated that the virtual environment of the BraveMind VR system does not entirely map the reality of Danish soldiers in Afghanistan. However, this was not experienced as a hindering factor in therapy. Findings indicate that BraveMind VRET is an acceptable, safe, and effective treatment for Danish veterans with PTSD. The qualitative results emphasize the importance of a strong therapeutic alliance, as VRET is experienced as more emotional straining than regular trauma-focused therapy.","author":[{"family":"Folke","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"Roitmann","given":"Nikolai"},{"family":"Poulsen","given":"Stig"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Søren B."}],"citation-key":"folkeFeasibilityVirtualReality2023","container-title":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking","container-title-short":"Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw","DOI":"10.1089/cyber.2022.0236","ISSN":"2152-2723","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"425-431","PMID":"37307409","source":"PubMed","title":"Feasibility of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in the Treatment of Danish Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Mixed Method Pilot Study","title-short":"Feasibility of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in the Treatment of Danish Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"forman-hoffmanEngagementSatisfactionMental2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a pervasive worldwide public health issue. Residentially vulnerable populations, such as those living in rural medically underserved areas (MUAs) or mental health provider shortage areas (MHPSAs), face unique access barriers to mental health care. Despite the growth of digital mental health interventions using relational agent technology, little is known about their use patterns, efficacy, and favorability among residentially vulnerable populations.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes, and satisfaction across residential subgroups (metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, or rural), MUAs (yes or no), and MHPSAs (yes or no) among users of a smartphone-based, digital mental health intervention, Woebot LIFE (WB-LIFE). WB-LIFE was designed to help users better understand and manage their moods and features a relational agent, Woebot, that converses through text-based messages.\nMETHODS: We used an exploratory study that examined data from 255 adults enrolled in an 8-week, single-arm trial of WB-LIFE. Analyses compared levels of app use and therapeutic alliance total scores as well as subscales (goal, task, and bond), mental health outcomes (depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, resilience, and burnout), and program satisfaction across residential subgroups.\nRESULTS: Few study participants resided in nonmetropolitan (25/255, 10%) or rural (3/255, 1%) areas, precluding estimates across this variable. Despite a largely metropolitan sample, nearly 39% (99/255) resided in an MUA and 55% (141/255) in an MHPSA. There were no significant differences in app use or satisfaction by MUA or MHPSA status. There also were no differences in depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, resilience, or burnout, with the exception of MUA participants having higher baseline depressive symptoms among those starting in the moderate range or higher (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item scale≥10) than non-MUA participants (mean 16.50 vs 14.41, respectively; P=.01). Although working alliance scores did not differ by MHPSA status, those who resided in an MUA had higher goal (2-tailed t203.47=2.21; P=.03), and bond (t203.47=1.94; P=.05) scores at day 3 (t192.98=2.15; P=.03), and higher goal scores at week 8 (t186.19=2.28; P=.02) as compared with those not living in an MUA.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the study not recruiting many participants from rural or nonmetropolitan populations, sizable proportions resided in an MUA or an MHPSA. Analyses revealed few differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes (including baseline levels), or satisfaction across MUA or MHPSA status over the 8-week study.

  {"id":"franceseTheaEmpoweringTherapeutic2021","abstract":"The Therapeutic Alliance (TA) between patient and health provider (therapist or clinician) is one of the most relevant factors for the success of a therapy. In the case of people suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the alliance is extended to all the people involved in their care (i.e., teachers, therapists, clinicians, relatives). In this paper, we propose a multimedia application named Thea for empowering the TA of children with ASD by improving the communication among the TA members, sharing guidelines, multimedia contents, and strategies to comply with challenging behaviors and progress with particular attention towards end-users who are occasional smart-users. A detailed process for empowering the TA members by enhancing the informed interaction among all of them is proposed and implemented. A vocal assistant also supports patients/caregivers and therapists in documenting their activity with the person with ASD by recording videos in a free-hand modality. After a contextual analysis based on Thematic Analysis Template, Thea has been implemented using a user-centered development approach. We performed three iterations involving the end-users. A user study is performed at the third iteration. Results of the user study revealed a positive attitude towards the application. In particular, the perception of empowerment of participants increased after the tool had been used. We also highlighted the guidelines and tools that may be adopted for empowering different kinds of patients.

Ratings for scientific quality (p = .10) and cognitive empathy (p = .08) were comparable to expert advice. Participants could not distinguish between AI- and expert-authored advice (p = .27), but perceived expert authorship was associated with more favorable ratings across these measures (ORs for perceived AI vs. perceived expert ranging from 0.03 to 0.15, all p < .001). For overall preference, AI-authored advice was favored when assessed blindly based on its actual source (β = 6.96, p = .002). Nevertheless, advice perceived as expert-authored was also strongly preferred (β = 6.26, p = .001), with 93.55 % of participants preferring the advice they believed came from an expert, irrespective of its true origin.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI demonstrates potential to match expert performance in asynchronous written psychological advice, but biases favoring perceived expert authorship may hinder its broader acceptance.

The papers published in the series point to key aspects of shifting the paradigm of musculoskeletal care from clinician-led management often focused on addressing presumed structural anomalies to partnering with patients to find individual strategies that empower patients towards self-management. Several papers in the series highlighted the need for developing patient-centred models of care that respect individual patient's needs and preferences. Also, the series pointed to different options for modes of delivery including mHealth and the challenges and opportunities they present for developing person-centred strategies. For health care to provide effective support for people with musculoskeletal pain conditions, there is a need to recognise that contextual factors, including a strong patient-provider alliance, clearly play an important, perhaps primary, role. Health care professions dealing with musculoskeletal pain conditions should engage in research to investigate effective ways to move this understanding into practice including how to train providers.

  {"id":"gangIntegrationSpiritualityWhole2022","abstract":"A novel whole person care course, emphasizing spirituality in healthcare, was developed for first-year Doctor of Physical Therapy students with interprofessional collaboration between faculty members of the School of Religion and the School of Allied Health physical therapy program. The course was designed to support compassionate, person-centered care, inclusive of spirituality, using the biopsychosocialspiritual framework. The purpose of this study was to explore physical therapy students' perceptions of spiritual care, identify student comfort level in addressing patient spiritual issues, and assess change in perception of the value of addressing spirituality with completion of a required whole person care course. Seventy-two first-year physical therapy students completed a 10-week required course with core course themes of religion and spirituality in healthcare, the practice of spiritual care, utilizing spiritual history tools, the concept of total pain, incorporating spirituality into therapeutic alliance, and developing capacity for empathy and compassion through spiritual practices. Stu¬dents were given pre- and post-course surveys to determine change in perceived importance of spirituality and whole person care in physical therapy. Quantitative results indicated a significant change in student perception from the beginning to completion of the course in all survey questions (p<0.001). Qualitative analysis of student reflections revealed six main themes in the categories of change and value, change in myself, change in future patient care, value of the patient's story, value of my story, value of new knowledge, and value of supportive classroom climate. Additionally, themes of personal wholeness, spiritual healing, and the reorientation to the \"why\" or mission of physical therapy emerged.

  {"id":"garrote-caparrosEffectivenessMindfulnessbasedInterventions2022","abstract":"In the field of psychotherapy, scientific research has highlighted the importance of empathy and therapeutic alliance in regard to the effectiveness and better results of psychological treatments. In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown to be effective at increasing empathy and therapeutic alliance and how this could affect the patients' symptomatology. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of MBIs applied to psychotherapists to improve their empathy, the therapeutic alliance and the patients' symptomatology. Sixteen studies evaluating the impact of an MBI on some of these variables were identified, of which six included measures evaluated by the patients whose psychotherapists received the MBI. The risk of bias of the included studies was analysed following the methodological standards. We found very different designs and methodologies in the studies included in this review, with few of them including a control group. The results show a limited increase in empathy, measured by the psychotherapist, after an MBI. However, the results in therapeutic alliance are not conclusive, as well as the improvements in the perception of patients about their symptomatology. It is concluded that MBIs can have a beneficial effect on the psychotherapeutic practice, through the development of psychotherapists' empathy. Future research would require new studies with a higher methodological quality, and in which the effects of MBIs on empathy, therapeutic alliance and patients' symptomatology and the relationships between them are analyzed.","author":[{"family":"Garrote-Caparrós","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Bellosta-Batalla","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Moya-Albiol","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Cebolla","given":"Ausiàs"}],"citation-key":"garrote-caparrosEffectivenessMindfulnessbasedInterventions2022","container-title":"Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1002/cpp.2676","ISSN":"1099-0879","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"783-798","PMID":"34687581","source":"PubMed","title":"Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on psychotherapy processes: A systematic review","title-short":"Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on psychotherapy processes","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"gayEnhancingPersonCentredCare2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Suicide prevention within nursing has historically been dominated by biomedical models that emphasize risk assessment and symptom management. While these frameworks offer structure and liability reduction, they often fail to capture the deeply personal and existential dimensions of suicidality. The reliance on predictive tools with modest accuracy, such as the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), has led to a gap between assessment and meaningful intervention. Critics argue that this model fosters a procedural approach that discourages patient disclosure and limits therapeutic engagement. In contrast, person-centered care (PCC) emphasizes relational trust, individualized understanding, and the integration of patient narratives into clinical decision-making. This paper examines the need to shift from standardized, symptom-focused approaches toward a dynamic, patient-centered framework.\nMETHODS: This paper critically evaluates the limitations of biomedical suicide prevention strategies by synthesizing theoretical contributions from key suicidologists, including Edwin Shneidman, Antoon Leenaars, Konrad Michel, Igor Galynker, and David Jobes. Evidence-based, person-centered models such as the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicide (CAMS) and the Narrative Crisis Model (NCM) are explored in contrast to traditional suicide risk assessments. Additionally, barriers to implementing PCC in nursing-such as time constraints, administrative demands, and gaps in professional training-are examined.\nRESULTS: While biomedical models provide standardized risk management strategies, their over-reliance on quantifiable indicators fails to address suicidality's multidimensional nature. The predictive limitations of suicide screening tools often lead to overestimation or underestimation of risk, increasing the likelihood of missed intervention opportunities. Furthermore, systemic factors such as high-acuity environments and compassion fatigue contribute to nurses' challenges in engaging with person-centered interventions. Models like CAMS and NCM have demonstrated greater efficacy in fostering trust, enhancing clinical engagement, and addressing the subjective experiences of suicidal individuals, ultimately improving outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The limitations of traditional biomedical approaches underscore the necessity of integrating person-centered care into nursing practice. Suicide prevention should not be dictated solely by standardized risk assessments but should instead prioritize therapeutic alliance, empathy, and the co-construction of meaning. Nurses, given their frontline role in patient care, are uniquely positioned to transform suicide prevention through narrative-based interventions and compassionate engagement. However, achieving this paradigm shift requires institutional support, expanded nursing education, and systemic recognition of the importance of relational care. This paper advocates for a holistic approach that moves beyond risk prediction toward meaningful, person-centered interventions that address the lived experiences and psychological distress of individuals at risk for suicide.","author":[{"family":"Gay","given":"Matias"}],"citation-key":"gayEnhancingPersonCentredCare2025","container-title":"Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing","container-title-short":"J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs","DOI":"10.1111/jpm.13168","ISSN":"1365-2850","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"891-896","PMID":"40099779","source":"PubMed","title":"Enhancing Person-Centred Care in Suicide Prevention: A Nursing Perspective","title-short":"Enhancing Person-Centred Care in Suicide Prevention","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"glajchenFamilyMeetingsPalliative2022","abstract":"Specialists in palliative care view the family meeting as a means to engage patients and their families in a serious illness discussion that may clarify the values of patients and caregivers, provide information, determine care preferences, and identify sources of illness-related distress and burden. The family meeting is considered the best practice for achieving patient- and family-centered care in palliative care. Although studies of the family meeting are limited, those extant suggest that these interventions may reduce caregiver distress, mitigate the perception of unmet needs, prepare family members for caregiving, and improve bereavement outcomes. The experience of palliative care specialists further suggests that the family meeting may reinforce the therapeutic alliance with families, promote consensus, and reduce the need for ad hoc meetings. Physician satisfaction may be enhanced when the treatment plan includes the opportunity to show empathy and see the family's perspective-core elements of the clinical approach to the family meeting. In the oncology setting, the potential to achieve these positive outcomes supports the integration of the family meeting into practice. Clinical skills for the planning and running of family meetings should be promoted with consideration of a standardized protocol for routine family meetings at critical points during the illness and its treatment using an interdisciplinary team. Further research is needed to refine understanding of the indications for the family meeting and determine the optimal timing, structure, and staffing models. Outcome studies employing validated measures are needed to better characterize the impact of family meetings on patient and family distress and on treatment outcomes. Although better evidence is needed to guide the future integration of the family meeting into oncology practice, current best practices can be recommended based on available data and the extensive observations of palliative care specialists.","author":[{"family":"Glajchen","given":"Myra"},{"family":"Goehring","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Johns","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Portenoy","given":"Russell K."}],"citation-key":"glajchenFamilyMeetingsPalliative2022","container-title":"Current Treatment Options in Oncology","container-title-short":"Curr Treat Options Oncol","DOI":"10.1007/s11864-022-00957-1","ISSN":"1534-6277","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"658-667","PMCID":"PMC8938578","PMID":"35316479","source":"PubMed","title":"Family Meetings in Palliative Care: Benefits and Barriers","title-short":"Family Meetings in Palliative Care","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"gonzalezComparingCancerGenetic2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Direct-to-patient telegenetics, which uses video conferencing to connect health professionals directly to patients' devices, has been widely adopted during the pandemic. However, limited evidence currently supports its use in cancer genetic counselling.\nMETHODS: Before the pandemic, we conducted a two-arm partially randomised patient-preference pilot trial to evaluate direct-to-patient telegenetics for patients and genetic counsellors. Patients were randomised to a standard care (telephone/in-person) or direct-to-patient telegenetics appointment. Patients completed questionnaires before, during and after appointments measuring: psychological distress, perceived genetic counsellor empathy, telegenetics satisfaction and technical challenges. Genetic counsellor-reported outcomes -measured using purpose-designed questionnaires- included telegenetics satisfaction, therapeutic alliance and time for assessment. Open-ended patient and genetic counsellor questionnaire responses were synthesised using content analysis.\nRESULTS: Fifty-six patients and seven genetic counsellors participated. Thirteen patients switched appointment type. No significant differences in distress (P  =  0.84) were identified between direct-to-patient telegenetics and standard care. Perceived genetic counsellor empathy was high for all appointment types. There was no evidence of differences in reported maximum empathy scores between direct-to-patient telegenetics and standard care [telephone (P  =  0.57); in-person (P  =  0.44)]. Patients reported high direct-to-patient telegenetics satisfaction despite technical challenges in most appointments (65%). Genetic counsellors were satisfied with direct-to-patient telegenetics and perceived high therapeutic alliance irrespective of appointment type. No significant differences in genetic counsellor time were identified between direct-to-patient telegenetics and standard care [telephone (P > 0.90); in-person (P  =  0.35)].\nDISCUSSION: Our results suggest that direct-to-patient telegenetics is a satisfactory service delivery model that does not appear to compromise patient-genetic counsellor relationships or increase patient distress. These findings support direct-to-patient telegenetics use in cancer genetic counselling, although larger trials are needed.","author":[{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Wakefield","given":"Claire E."},{"family":"Geelan-Small","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Macmillan","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Rachel"}],"citation-key":"gonzalezComparingCancerGenetic2024","container-title":"Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare","container-title-short":"J Telemed Telecare","DOI":"10.1177/1357633X221112556","ISSN":"1758-1109","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"949-960","PMID":"35833346","source":"PubMed","title":"Comparing cancer genetic counselling using telegenetics with in-person and telephone appointments: Results of a partially randomised patient-preference pilot study","title-short":"Comparing cancer genetic counselling using telegenetics with in-person and telephone appointments","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"grodniewiczWaitingDigitalTherapist2023","abstract":"Growing demand for broadly accessible mental health care, together with the rapid development of new technologies, trigger discussions about the feasibility of psychotherapeutic interventions based on interactions with Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI). Many authors argue that while currently available CAI can be a useful supplement for human-delivered psychotherapy, it is not yet capable of delivering fully fledged psychotherapy on its own. The goal of this paper is to investigate what are the most important obstacles on our way to developing CAI systems capable of delivering psychotherapy in the future. To this end, we formulate and discuss three challenges central to this quest. Firstly, we might not be able to develop effective AI-based psychotherapy unless we deepen our understanding of what makes human-delivered psychotherapy effective. Secondly, assuming that it requires building a therapeutic relationship, it is not clear whether psychotherapy can be delivered by non-human agents. Thirdly, conducting psychotherapy might be a problem too complicated for narrow AI, i.e., AI proficient in dealing with only relatively simple and well-delineated tasks. If this is the case, we should not expect CAI to be capable of delivering fully-fledged psychotherapy until the so-called \"general\" or \"human-like\" AI is developed. While we believe that all these challenges can ultimately be overcome, we think that being mindful of them is crucial to ensure well-balanced and steady progress on our path to AI-based psychotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Grodniewicz","given":"J.

  {"id":"grossPersonalizationConversationalAgentPatient2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Conversational agents (CAs) for chronic disease management are receiving increasing attention in academia and the industry. However, long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and, with it, user satisfaction, task efficiency, perceived benefits, and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects, such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However, detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and outcome, as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently, it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic, informative, interpretive, or deliberative interaction style, and (2) which factors influence these preferences.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles.\nMETHODS: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results, a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables.\nRESULTS: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients, younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18; intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01; working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04; working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01; interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior.","author":[{"family":"Gross","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Schachner","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Hasl","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Kohlbrenner","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Clarenbach","given":"Christian F."},{"family":"Wangenheim","given":"Forian V."},{"family":"Kowatsch","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"grossPersonalizationConversationalAgentPatient2021","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/26643","ISSN":"1438-8871","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"e26643","PMCID":"PMC8190651","PMID":"33913814","source":"PubMed","title":"Personalization of Conversational Agent-Patient Interaction Styles for Chronic Disease Management: Two Consecutive Cross-sectional Questionnaire Studies","title-short":"Personalization of Conversational Agent-Patient Interaction Styles for Chronic Disease Management","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"guhanDevelopingMachineLearningBased2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patient engagement is a critical but challenging public health priority in behavioral health care. During telehealth sessions, health care providers need to rely predominantly on verbal strategies rather than typical nonverbal cues to effectively engage patients. Hence, the typical patient engagement behaviors are now different, and health care provider training on telehealth patient engagement is unavailable or quite limited. Therefore, we explore the application of machine learning for estimating patient engagement. This can assist psychotherapists in the development of a therapeutic relationship with the patient and enhance patient engagement in the treatment of mental health conditions during tele-mental health sessions.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the ability of machine learning models to estimate patient engagement levels during a tele-mental health session and understand whether the machine learning approach could support therapeutic engagement between the client and psychotherapist.\nMETHODS: We proposed a multimodal learning-based approach. We uniquely leveraged latent vectors corresponding to affective and cognitive features frequently used in psychology literature to understand a person's level of engagement. Given the labeled data constraints that exist in health care, we explored a semisupervised learning solution. To support the development of similar technologies for telehealth, we also plan to release a dataset called Multimodal Engagement Detection in Clinical Analysis (MEDICA). This dataset includes 1229 video clips, each lasting 3 seconds. In addition, we present experiments conducted on this dataset, along with real-world tests that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nRESULTS: Our algorithm reports a 40% improvement in root mean square error over state-of-the-art methods for engagement estimation. In our real-world tests on 438 video clips from psychotherapy sessions with 20 patients, in comparison to prior methods, positive correlations were observed between psychotherapists' Working Alliance Inventory scores and our mean and median engagement level estimates. This indicates the potential of the proposed model to present patient engagement estimations that align well with the engagement measures used by psychotherapists.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement has been identified as being important to improve therapeutic alliance. However, limited research has been conducted to measure this in a telehealth setting, where the therapist lacks conventional cues to make a confident assessment. The algorithm developed is an attempt to model person-oriented engagement modeling theories within machine learning frameworks to estimate the level of engagement of the patient accurately and reliably in telehealth. The results are encouraging and emphasize the value of combining psychology and machine learning to understand patient engagement. Further testing in the real-world setting is necessary to fully assess its usefulness in helping therapists gauge patient engagement during online sessions. However, the proposed approach and the creation of the new dataset, MEDICA, open avenues for future research and the development of impactful tools for telehealth.","author":[{"family":"Guhan","given":"Pooja"},{"family":"Awasthi","given":"Naman"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Bussell","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Reeves","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Manocha","given":"Dinesh"},{"family":"Bera","given":"Aniket"}],"citation-key":"guhanDevelopingMachineLearningBased2025","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/46390","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"e46390","PMCID":"PMC11791444","PMID":"39832353","source":"PubMed","title":"Developing a Machine Learning-Based Automated Patient Engagement Estimator for Telehealth: Algorithm Development and Validation Study","title-short":"Developing a Machine Learning-Based Automated Patient Engagement Estimator for Telehealth","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"guptaDeliveryMentalHealth2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience coexisting, long-term and debilitating mental health comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Artificial intelligence-supported cognitive behavioral therapy (AI-CBT) interventions could offer cost-effective, accessible, and potentially effective resources to address this problem. However, there is not enough research conducted about the efficacy of AI-CBT interventions for chronic pain.\nOBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aims to examine the efficacy and use of an AI-CBT intervention for chronic pain (Wysa for Chronic Pain app, Wysa Inc) using a conversational agent (with no human intervention). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study for chronic pain using a fully-automated, free-text-based conversational agent.\nMETHODS: Participants with self-reported chronic pain (n=500) will be recruited online on a rolling basis from April 2022 through posts on US-based internet communities within this prospective cohort. Informed consent is received from participants within the app, and the Wysa for Chronic Pain intervention is delivered remotely for 8 weeks. Outcome measures including a numeric pain rating scale and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Pain Interference, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 questionnaires administered to test the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety. The therapeutic alliance created with the conversational agent will be assessed through the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised instrument. Retention and use statistics will be observed for adherence and engagement.\nRESULTS: The study will open for recruitment in April 2022, and data collection is expected to be completed by August 2022. The results for the primary outcomes are expected to be published by late 2022.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mental health conversational agents driven by artificial intelligence could be effective in helping patients with chronic pain learn to self-manage their pain and common comorbidities like depression and anxiety.

One way to facilitate MOBC-informed care in frontline settings could be to measure and monitor changes in MOBC throughout treatment using brief, frequent questionnaires that patients complete by using mobile technologies (eg, smartphones). The results derived from these questionnaires could potentially be used for clinical monitoring (ie, measurement-based care) to better understand whether individual patients are experiencing treatment-related improvements on key clinical targets.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether brief, weekly MOBC questionnaires completed by patients remotely can potentially provide clinically meaningful information about changes in MOBC in the context of real-world, community-based SUD treatment.\nMETHODS: A total of 30 patients (14/30, 47% female; 13/30, 43% racial or ethnic minority) in a community SUD treatment clinic participated in a pilot study where they were invited to complete brief, weekly questionnaires that assessed various MOBC, including coping strategies, abstinence self-efficacy, craving, depression, and therapeutic alliance. Questionnaires were typically completed remotely via smartphone for up to 6 months; 618 questionnaires were completed in total. Participants also completed longer, psychometrically validated measures of the same MOBC at baseline and 6-month research appointments. Statistical analyses tested whether brief, weekly, remotely completed MOBC questionnaires exhibited characteristics that would be desirable for real-world longitudinal clinical monitoring, including a tendency to detect within-person changes in MOBC over time; cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with longer, psychometrically validated measures completed at research appointments; and similar patterns of associations with 6-month percentage of days abstinent as longer, psychometrically validated MOBC measures completed at research appointments.\nRESULTS: The results of this study indicated that the brief, weekly, remotely completed MOBC measures exhibited characteristics that are desirable for clinical monitoring, including a tendency to vary longitudinally (within patients over time) more often than measures of alcohol and drug consumption, generally having medium to large cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations with longer psychometrically validated measures of MOBC completed at research appointments, and generally having similar patterns of association with 6-month percentage of days abstinent from alcohol and drugs as longer psychometrically validated MOBC measures completed at research appointments.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study provide initial evidence that incorporating brief, weekly, and remotely completed MOBC questionnaires into community SUD treatment may be a viable approach for facilitating MOBC-informed care. Such questionnaires can potentially support measurement-based care by providing meaningful information about within-patient changes in clinical domains that are often directly targeted in SUD treatments and predict long-term substance use outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Hallgren","given":"Kevin A."}],"citation-key":"hallgrenRemotelyAssessingMechanisms2022","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/42376","ISSN":"2561-326X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"e42376","PMCID":"PMC9679949","PMID":"36342773","source":"PubMed","title":"Remotely Assessing Mechanisms of Behavioral Change in Community Substance Use Disorder Treatment to Facilitate Measurement-Informed Care: Pilot Longitudinal Questionnaire Study","title-short":"Remotely Assessing Mechanisms of Behavioral Change in Community Substance Use Disorder Treatment to Facilitate Measurement-Informed Care","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"hammelrathSelectAdjustHow2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions produce comparable effectiveness rates as face-to-face therapy in treating depression. Still, more than half of patients do not respond to treatment. Machine learning (ML) methods could help to overcome these low response rates by predicting therapy outcomes on an individual level and tailoring treatment accordingly. Few studies implemented ML algorithms in internet-based depression treatment using baseline self-report data, but differing results hinder inferences on clinical practicability. This work compares algorithms using features gathered at baseline or early in treatment in their capability to predict non-response to a 6-week online program targeting depression.\nMETHODS: Our training and test sample encompassed 1270 and 318 individuals, respectively. We trained random forest algorithms on self-report and process features gathered at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment. Non-responders were defined as participants not fulfilling the criteria for reliable and clinically significant change on PHQ-9 post-treatment. Our benchmark models were logistic regressions trained on baseline PHQ-9 sum or PHQ-9 early change, using 100 iterations of randomly sampled 80/20 train-test-splits.\nRESULTS: Best performances were reached by our models involving early treatment characteristics (recall: 0.75-0.76; AUC: 0.71-0.77). Therapeutic alliance and early symptom change constituted the most important predictors. Models trained on baseline data were not significantly better than our benchmark.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fair accuracies were only attainable by involving information from early treatment stages. In-treatment adaptation, instead of a priori selection, might constitute a more feasible approach for improving response when relying on easily accessible self-report features. Implementation trials are needed to determine clinical usefulness.","author":[{"family":"Hammelrath","given":"Leona"},{"family":"Hilbert","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Zagorscak","given":"Pavle"},{"family":"Knaevelsrud","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"hammelrathSelectAdjustHow2024","container-title":"Psychological Medicine","container-title-short":"Psychol Med","DOI":"10.1017/S0033291723003537","ISSN":"1469-8978","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"1641-1650","PMID":"38087867","source":"PubMed","title":"Select or adjust?

Using a convergent mixed methods approach, data were tabulated using a person, intervention and context model. Participant summaries were grouped into outcome typologies, followed by an analysis of data convergence and divergence within each and an interpretation of identified patterns.\nRESULTS: Three outcome response typologies were identified: dramatic improvement, moderate improvement and minimal improvement. Within the person domain, factors associated with outcomes included walking capacity, commitment and ability to complete therapy, and levels of subjective distress. Within the intervention domain, factors associated with outcomes related to image selection and use, therapeutic alliance and orientations towards the tailoring of sessions. Within the context domain, factors associated with outcomes included reactions to the therapy environment. The patterning of secondary outcomes broadly corresponded with primary outcomes within each typology. Alongside patterned data differentiating aspects of the person, intervention and context domains, within the three response typologies data also existed where no obvious patterning was detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: The model developed here may have novel value in evaluating a range of personalised interventions, but further work is needed before confident assertions can be made of who is likely to benefit from 3MDR specifically.","author":[{"family":"Hannigan","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Deursen","given":"Robert","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Barawi","given":"Kali"},{"family":"Kitchiner","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Bisson","given":"Jonathan I."}],"citation-key":"hanniganFactorsAssociatedOutcomes2023","container-title":"PloS One","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0285763","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e0285763","PMCID":"PMC10212105","PMID":"37228076","source":"PubMed","title":"Factors associated with the outcomes of a novel virtual reality therapy for military veterans with PTSD: Theory development using a mixed methods analysis","title-short":"Factors associated with the outcomes of a novel virtual reality therapy for military veterans with PTSD","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

To support youth with emotion dysregulation, dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) includes a multi-family skills group, wherein adolescents and caregivers learn skills together. However, limited work has examined the impact of caregiver involvement within DBT-A. The current study examines outcomes of two caregiver-only DBT-A skills groups adapted for abbreviated telehealth delivery. We report on caregivers' (N = 11, 100% mothers, 55% Hispanic) service user outcomes (e.g. self-efficacy at skill usage, group cohesion, therapeutic alliance) and clinical outcomes (i.e. their own emotion functioning, criticism, responses to their adolescent's negative emotions). Results indicate caregiver-only groups were feasible and acceptable, and suggest preliminary efficacy, including improvements in caregiver emotion functioning, distress during interactions with their adolescents, and adolescent-reported criticism. Caregivers also reported reductions in unsupportive responses with their adolescents. Overall, while we caution interpretation due to a small sample size, findings support the preliminary feasibility and efficacy of modifying caregiver participation in DBT-A to be less time-consuming and administered via telehealth.","author":[{"family":"Hare","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Conroy","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Georgiadis","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Ashley M."}],"citation-key":"hareAbbreviatedDialecticalBehavior2024","container-title":"Child Psychiatry and Human Development","container-title-short":"Child Psychiatry Hum Dev","DOI":"10.1007/s10578-024-01681-7","ISSN":"1573-3327","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"language":"eng","PMID":"38530589","source":"PubMed","title":"Abbreviated Dialectical Behavior Therapy Virtual Skills Group for Caregivers of Adolescents: An Exploratory Study of Service User and Clinical Outcomes","title-short":"Abbreviated Dialectical Behavior Therapy Virtual Skills Group for Caregivers of Adolescents","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"hasanEfficacyTherapeuticAlliance2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Phobic disorders are characterized by excessive fear of a stimulus that can affect the quality of a patient's life. The lifetime prevalence in adults is 7.7% to 12.5%. The current literature provides evidence-based inferences about the effectiveness of in-vivo exposure therapy (IVET) in treating phobia. However, this method can put the therapist and the client in danger, with high drop out and refusal rates. A newer approach for exposure therapy using augmented reality technology is under assessment.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review investigated the novel technology's efficacy, cost-efficacy, and therapeutic alliance in treating adults with phobia.\nMETHODS: An extensive search was conducted using 4 major databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Scopus) using a comprehensive list of synonyms for augmented reality exposure therapy (ARET) and phobic disorders. The search targeted any randomized control trial testing ARET in adults with phobic disorders up to August 8, 2022.\nRESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included, with 208 participants providing results. Studies investigating the efficacy of ARET compared to no intervention showed significant results (P<.05) in the ARET group improvement. Head-to-head comparative studies comparing ARET to IVET showed no significant difference (P>.05) in the effectiveness and therapeutic alliance between both therapies. Further, the results demonstrated that the ARET group had a better long-term effect than IVET, with the ability to put the patients in more situations to face the feared object.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest clinically significant efficacy and a promising therapeutic alliance of ARET. However, no data are available investigating the cost-effectiveness of ARET. Further research is warranted to ascertain ARET's cost-effectiveness and examine its efficacy in other populations and anxiety conditions.","author":[{"family":"Hasan","given":"Safa"},{"family":"Alhaj","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Hassoulas","given":"Athanasios"}],"citation-key":"hasanEfficacyTherapeuticAlliance2023","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/51318","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,30]]},"language":"eng","page":"e51318","PMCID":"PMC10722365","PMID":"38032710","source":"PubMed","title":"The Efficacy and Therapeutic Alliance of Augmented Reality Exposure Therapy in Treating Adults With Phobic Disorders: Systematic Review","title-short":"The Efficacy and Therapeutic Alliance of Augmented Reality Exposure Therapy in Treating Adults With Phobic Disorders","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

While cessation support provided by healthcare professionals is effective, its use remains low. Chatbots have the potential to serve as a useful addition. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of using a motivational interviewing style chatbot to enhance engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy in the context of smoking cessation.\nMETHODS: A preregistered web-based experiment was conducted in which smokers (n = 153) were randomly assigned to either the motivational interviewing (MI)-style chatbot condition (n = 78) or the neutral chatbot condition (n = 75) and interacted with the chatbot in two sessions. In the assessment session, typical intake questions in smoking cessation interventions were administered by the chatbot, such as smoking history, nicotine dependence level, and intention to quit. In the feedback session, the chatbot provided personalized normative feedback and discussed with participants potential reasons to quit. Engagement with the chatbot, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy were the primary outcomes and were assessed after both sessions. Secondary outcomes were motivation to quit and perceived communication competence and were assessed after the two sessions.\nRESULTS: No significant effects of the experimental manipulation (MI-style or neutral chatbot) were found on engagement, therapeutic alliance, or perceived empathy. A significant increase in therapeutic alliance over two sessions emerged in both conditions, with participants reporting significantly increased motivation to quit. The chatbot was perceived as highly competent, and communication competence was positively associated with engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this preregistered study suggest that talking with a chatbot about smoking cessation can help to motivate smokers to quit and that the effect of conversation has the potential to build up over time.

Roby engaged Dutch adult smokers (N = 102) in conversations covering topics such as setting a quit date, managing withdrawal and cravings, and relapse prevention. The primary outcome was the continuous abstinence rate at the end of the intervention, and secondary outcomes included 7-day point prevalence abstinence, self-efficacy, and cravings.

In addition, we sought to gain insights into smokers' expectations of and experiences with the chatbot.\nMETHODS: This mixed methods study incorporated a web-based experiment and semistructured interviews. Smokers (N=229) interacted with either a motivational interviewing (MI)-style (n=112, 48.9%) or a confrontational counseling-style (n=117, 51.1%) chatbot. Both cessation-related (ie, intention to quit and self-efficacy) and user experience-related outcomes (ie, engagement, therapeutic alliance, perceived empathy, and interaction satisfaction) were assessed. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 participants, 8 (50%) from each condition, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Results from a multivariate ANOVA showed that participants had a significantly higher overall rating for the MI (vs confrontational counseling) chatbot. Follow-up discriminant analysis revealed that the better perception of the MI chatbot was mostly explained by the user experience-related outcomes, with cessation-related outcomes playing a lesser role. Exploratory analyses indicated that smokers in both conditions reported increased intention to quit and self-efficacy after the chatbot interaction. Interview findings illustrated several constructs (eg, affective attitude and engagement) explaining people's previous expectations and timely and retrospective experience with the chatbot.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that chatbots are a promising tool in motivating smoking cessation and the use of MI can improve user experience. We did not find extra support for MI to motivate cessation and have discussed possible reasons. Smokers expressed both relational and instrumental needs in the quitting process.

However, mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: In a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS).\nRESULTS: Participants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in the XiaoE group compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group at both T1 (F2,136=17.011; P<.001; d=0.51) and T2 (F2,136=5.477; P=.005; d=0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ; F2,145=3.407; P=.04) and acceptability (AS; F2,145=4.322; P=.02) were discovered with XiaoE, while no significant difference among arms was found for usability (UMUX-LITE; F2,145=0.968; P=.38).\nCONCLUSIONS: A CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic approach that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms.

A search for articles was carried out in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, OTseeker and Dialnet. They were selected according to the eligibility criteria. Internal quality assessment of the articles was measured with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ). The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (ID 346523). The search in the databases identified 1596 articles, from which 9 different studies were finally included in the systematic review, reflecting the limitations of studies in this field. All studies are qualitative, from the point of view of the patients themselves, their relatives and healthcare professionals. The total sample of the included studies is 182 participants (96 health professionals, 76 users and 10 relatives). Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and written reflections were mainly used to collect the data.

Given the importance of empathy in establishing a therapeutic alliance, theoretically psychologists would benefit from choosing left cheek portraits to enhance their perceived emotionality. The present study thus examined psychologists' posing biases in photographs uploaded to online \"Find a Psychologist\" resources. Images (N = 1230) of psychologists were drawn from professional \"Find a Psychologist\" online databases, and coded for gender, portrait type and cheek shown. Results confirmed that psychologists show a left cheek bias, irrespective of gender and across portrait types (upper body, full body). This distinguishes psychologists from doctors and surgeons: past research reports no cheek bias in photos uploaded to \"Find a Doctor\" websites. The current findings suggest that psychologists may intuitively select left cheek images to enhance the communication of empathy to potential clients.","author":[{"family":"Hew","given":"Ven Yi"},{"family":"Lindell","given":"Annukka K."}],"citation-key":"hewPuttingYourBest2022","container-title":"Laterality","container-title-short":"Laterality","DOI":"10.1080/1357650X.2022.2077745","ISSN":"1464-0678","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"406-414","PMID":"35588260","source":"PubMed","title":"Putting your best face forward: Posing biases in psychologists' online portraits","title-short":"Putting your best face forward","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"hillItsNotYou2021","abstract":"In this essay, a medical student details how she struggled to let go of a patient with whom she connected throughout the patient's pregnancy during her second year of medical school. Although she learned in her preclinical \"doctoring\" courses how to build quick connections with patients, such training did not delve into how to manage meaningful, emotionally complex connections that may form with patients during longitudinal rotations or, as in this case, extracurricular activities. While primary care physicians may have decades of practice managing evolving longitudinal relationships, medical students who form strong connections with patients are just learning what it means to navigate those relationships, some of which come to an end. Reflecting on the end of this particular relationship helped the author appreciate the power of the longitudinal physician-patient relationship and taught her that taking care of patients also requires taking care of one's self.","author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"Melissa B."}],"citation-key":"hillItsNotYou2021","container-title":"Annals of Family Medicine","container-title-short":"Ann Fam Med","DOI":"10.1370/afm.2644","ISSN":"1544-1717","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"271-273","PMCID":"PMC8118492","PMID":"34180848","source":"PubMed","title":"It's Not You, It's Me: Learning to Navigate the Patient-Physician Relationship","title-short":"It's Not You, It's Me","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"hiltyBestPracticesTechnology2023","abstract":"The shift to communication technologies during the pandemic has had positive and negative effects on clinical social worker practice. Best practices are identified for clinical social workers to maintain emotional well-being, prevent fatigue, and avoid burnout when using technology. A scoping review from 2000 to 21 of 15 databases focused on communication technologies for mental health care within four areas: (1) behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and physical impact; (2) individual, clinic, hospital, and system/organizational levels; (3) well-being, burnout, and stress; and (4) clinician technology perceptions. Out of 4795 potential literature references, full text review of 201 papers revealed 37 were related to technology impact on engagement, therapeutic alliance, fatigue and well-being. Studies assessed behavioral (67.5%), emotional (43.2%), cognitive (57.8%), and physical (10.8%) impact at the individual (78.4%), clinic (54.1%), hospital (37.8%) and system/organizational (45.9%) levels. Participants were clinicians, social workers, psychologists, and other providers. Clinicians can build a therapeutic alliance via video, but this requires additional skill, effort, and monitoring. Use of video and electronic health records were associated with clinician physical and emotional problems due to barriers, effort, cognitive demands, and additional workflow steps. Studies also found high user ratings on data quality, accuracy, and processing, but low satisfaction with clerical tasks, effort required and interruptions. Studies have overlooked the impact of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion related to technology, fatigue and well-being, for the populations served and the clinicians providing care. Clinical social workers and health care systems must evaluate the impact of technology in order to support well-being and prevent workload burden, fatigue, and burnout. Multi-level evaluation and clinical, human factor, training/professional development and administrative best practices are suggested.","author":[{"family":"Hilty","given":"Donald M."},{"family":"Groshong","given":"Laura W."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Mirean"},{"family":"Maheu","given":"Marlene M."},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Christina M."},{"family":"Smout","given":"Shelby A."},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Drude","given":"Kenneth P."},{"family":"Krupinski","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"hiltyBestPracticesTechnology2023","container-title":"Clinical Social Work Journal","container-title-short":"Clin Soc Work J","DOI":"10.1007/s10615-023-00865-3","ISSN":"0091-1674","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-35","PMCID":"PMC10233199","PMID":"37360756","source":"PubMed","title":"Best Practices for Technology in Clinical Social Work and Mental Health Professions to Promote Well-being and Prevent Fatigue","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"hinzFillingFormExpressive2024","abstract":"Sara was a 65-year-old Caucasian woman who requested art therapy after the death of her partner. She had experienced incest by her father and verbal abuse by her mother until she left home at 21. Her life was characterized by broken relationships due to alienating anger outbursts and an interrupted work history; she met three criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. Sara initially was socially isolated and intellectualizing. She desired recognition but was fearful of exposure. The Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) theoretical framework, which consisted of a gradual progression from cognitively-dominated sessions to more emotionally focused processing, guided the therapeutic work. The ETC theory encourages transparency and collaboration between therapist and client regarding therapeutic tasks and goals, and provides a framework for addressing and repairing ruptures in the therapeutic alliance. Art therapy began with the cognitive tasks which Sara completed relatively comfortably, then encouraged integration of emotion via expressive writing, diagrams, and body mapping. Through careful attention to repair of ruptures by directly discussing and adapting the direction and tasks of therapy, Sara slowly was able to experience emotions other than anger. She integrated cognitive and emotional insights about her life and developed empathy for her childhood self. At termination Sara had cultivated two friendships and met only one criterion of NPD. Limitations of this case study include a lack of research evidence for ETC-guided art therapy with NPD clients and by the retrospective approach. Future research efforts could provide this support by encouraging clinicians to conduct prospective case study research.","author":[{"family":"Hinz","given":"Lisa D."}],"citation-key":"hinzFillingFormExpressive2024","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","container-title-short":"J Clin Psychol","DOI":"10.1002/jclp.23635","ISSN":"1097-4679","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"1192-1206","PMID":"38178697","source":"PubMed","title":"Filling the form: Expressive Therapies Continuum-guided treatment of narcissistic personality disorder","title-short":"Filling the form","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},

Obtaining a better understanding could lend clues about recommended use for particular subgroups of the population, the potency of different intervention components, and the mechanisms underlying the intervention's success.\nOBJECTIVE: This exploratory study applied clustering techniques to a range of engagement indicators, which were mapped to the intervention's active components and the connect, attend, participate, and enact (CAPE) model, to examine the prevalence and characterization of each identified cluster among users of a relational agent-guided DMHI.\nMETHODS: We invited adults aged 18 years or older who were interested in using digital support to help with mood management or stress reduction through social media to participate in an 8-week DMHI guided by a natural language processing-supported relational agent, Woebot. Users completed assessments of affective and cognitive engagement, working alliance as measured by goal and task working alliance subscale scores, and enactment (ie, application of therapeutic recommendations in real-world settings). The app passively collected data on behavioral engagement (ie, utilization). We applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis to the engagement indicators to identify the number of clusters that provided the best fit to the data collected, characterized the clusters, and then examined associations with baseline demographic and clinical characteristics as well as mental health outcomes at week 8.\nRESULTS: Exploratory analyses (n=202) supported 3 clusters: (1) \"typical utilizers\" (n=81, 40%), who had intermediate levels of behavioral engagement; (2) \"early utilizers\" (n=58, 29%), who had the nominally highest levels of behavioral engagement in week 1; and (3) \"efficient engagers\" (n=63, 31%), who had significantly higher levels of affective and cognitive engagement but the lowest level of behavioral engagement. With respect to mental health baseline and outcome measures, efficient engagers had significantly higher levels of baseline resilience (P<.001) and greater declines in depressive symptoms (P=.01) and stress (P=.01) from baseline to week 8 compared to typical utilizers. Significant differences across clusters were found by age, gender identity, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, and insurance coverage. The main analytic findings remained robust in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were 3 distinct engagement clusters found, each with distinct baseline demographic and clinical traits and mental health outcomes. Additional research is needed to inform fine-grained recommendations regarding optimal engagement and to determine the best sequence of particular intervention components with known potency. The findings represent an important first step in disentangling the complex interplay between different affective, cognitive, and behavioral engagement indicators and outcomes associated with use of a DMHI incorporating a natural language processing-supported relational agent.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05672745; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05672745.","author":[{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Flom","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Mariano","given":"Timothy Y."},{"family":"Chiauzzi","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Kirvin-Quamme","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Pajarito","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Durden","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Perski","given":"Olga"}],"citation-key":"hoffmanUserEngagementClusters2023","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/47198","ISSN":"1438-8871","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"language":"eng","page":"e47198","PMCID":"PMC10612009","PMID":"37831490","source":"PubMed","title":"User Engagement Clusters of an 8-Week Digital Mental Health Intervention Guided by a Relational Agent (Woebot): Exploratory Study","title-short":"User Engagement Clusters of an 8-Week Digital Mental Health Intervention Guided by a Relational Agent (Woebot)","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

The idea of finding a common \"umbrella\" for all evidence-based treatments in the field of psychotherapy is gaining more interest. Based on this background, experts in clinical psychology from various backgrounds led a fundamental discussion about modern psychotherapy and its basic mechanisms. Process-Based Therapy (PBT) was presented by Stefan Hofmann as a possible novel approach to clinical research and practice. In this article we present the different perspectives of the four panelists on PBT and in how far the model builds a common ground for different treatment approaches. Learning mechanisms and the therapeutic alliance were almost unanimously considered as indispensable factors in a global model of psychotherapy. In conclusion, the panelists emphasized a much-needed focus on characteristics and competencies of therapists themselves e.g., in communication, listening and empathy. These core competencies should be trained and promoted independently of the therapeutic approach.","author":[{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Stefan G."},{"family":"Barber","given":"Jacques P."},{"family":"Salkovskis","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Wampold","given":"Bruce E."},{"family":"Rief","given":"Winfried"},{"family":"Ewen","given":"Anne-Catherine I."},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Leonora Nina"}],"citation-key":"hofmannWhatCommonGround2022","container-title":"Clinical Psychology in Europe","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Eur","DOI":"10.32872/cpe.8403","ISSN":"2625-3410","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"e8403","PMCID":"PMC9667344","PMID":"36397744","source":"PubMed","title":"What Is the Common Ground for Modern Psychotherapy?

Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws, which create a path through a civil court process to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others and are one strategy designed to reduce firearm violence. Maryland was the first state to authorize clinicians as ERPO petitioners.\nOBJECTIVE: We aim to document a sample of Maryland physicians' perspectives about the utility of, any barriers to, and other thoughts on clinicians as ERPO petitioners.\nDESIGN: A series of semi-structured interviews with Maryland physicians identified through a combination of purposive and snowball sampling. We coded the transcribed interviews and analyzed the coded transcripts for themes using deductive content analysis.\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 13 Maryland-based physicians interviewed over Zoom in and around Baltimore City, Maryland.\nRESULTS: The interviewees had overall positive feedback about ERPO as a gun violence prevention tool in the clinical setting. They identified several barriers to effective implementation such as time spent on paperwork and in court, a lack of awareness among clinicians about ERPO, threats to therapeutic alliance, and a sense of futility in a culture where firearms are easy to obtain. Solutions such as providing clinician education about ERPO laws, allowing for virtual court testimony, and creating a consult service with ERPO specialists to manage ERPO petitions were discussed.\nLIMITATIONS: This study includes a small sample of Maryland-based physicians.\nCONCLUSIONS: The physicians we interviewed expressed interest in knowing more about ERPO laws and emphasized education as an important tool for improving implementation. Addressing physicians' concerns about ERPO implementation will improve their ability to be effective and efficient petitioners.","author":[{"family":"Hollo","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"VanderStoep","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Frattaroli","given":"Shannon"}],"citation-key":"holloPhysiciansPerspectivesExtreme2022","container-title":"PloS One","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0274489","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e0274489","PMCID":"PMC9469965","PMID":"36099263","source":"PubMed","title":"Physicians' perspectives on Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) in the clinical setting: Challenges and opportunities for gun violence prevention","title-short":"Physicians' perspectives on Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) in the clinical setting","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

How people discuss CIH with their biomedical providers is a microcosm for health communication more generally. In this Discussion, we propose a revision of the Street et al. (2009) conceptual framework to illustrate how CIH talk during a clinical encounter has the potential to contribute to (or detract from) interactional health equity.\nMETHODS: We use discourse analytic techniques to re-analyze two digitally recorded biomedical encounters.\nRESULTS: Two case studies are re-analyzed to illustrate how clinician-client conversation about CIH during a clinical encounter might lead to interactional health equity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Interactions with clinicians can be challenging due to differences in knowledge about biomedicine, administrative processes, and even navigating interpersonal relationships. How a clinician responds can either center a biomedical agenda in the Voice of Medicine or help ratify a patient's agenda in the Voice of the Lifeworld. How clinicians and patients negotiate CIH talk is conceptually linked with immediate interactional outcomes.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: In populations in which patients/caregivers or their extended communities may already have low trust in biomedicine, a mistrustful therapeutic alliance, or history of discrimination, disattention of the Lifeworld and avoiding talk about CIH has the possibility of exacerbating inequities. Every turn at talk during a clinical encounter has the potential to foster increased social participation which, in turn, may contribute to health outcomes and influence patient and community well-being at individual, community, and institutional levels. CIH talk can open space for patients to actively participate in healthcare by incorporating the patients' Lifeworld into the clinical encounter and can contribute to interactional health equity within clinical encounters.","author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Evelyn Y."},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Christopher J."}],"citation-key":"hoPromotingInteractionalHealth2025","container-title":"Patient Education and Counseling","container-title-short":"Patient Educ Couns","DOI":"10.1016/j.pec.2025.108651","ISSN":"1873-5134","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"108651","PMID":"39862491","source":"PubMed","title":"Promoting interactional health equity through (Complementary and Integrative Health) talk during clinical encounters","type":"article-journal","volume":"134"},
  {"id":"horigomeModificationTherapistsFacial2023","abstract":"Exposure therapy is a mainstream of treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, effort and time are required to recreate interpersonal situations that produce moderate anxiety. On the other hand, virtual reality exposure therapy can easily control anxiety-inducing conditions and allow for graduated exposure. However, artificial intelligence and animations that speak as naturally as actual humans are not yet practical, adding to the limitations of these treatments. The authors propose the use of a virtual reality technology that can transform facial expressions into smiling or sad faces in real time and display them on a monitor, potentially solving the above-mentioned problems associated with virtual reality animations. This feasibility study was conducted to determine whether this system can be safely applied to the treatment of SAD patients. A total of four SAD patients received 16 exposure therapy sessions led by an experienced therapist over a monitor; throughout the sessions, the facial expressions of the therapist were modified using software to display expressions ranging from smiling to sad on the monitor that was being viewed by the patient. Client satisfaction, treatment alliance, and symptom assessments were then conducted. Although one patient dropped out of the study, treatment satisfaction and treatment alliance were scored high in all the cases. In two of the four cases, the improvement in symptoms was sustained over time. Exposure therapy in which the interviewer's facial expressions are modified to induce appropriate levels of anxiety in the patient can be safely used for the treatment of SAD patients and may be effective for some patients.","author":[{"family":"Horigome","given":"Toshiro"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Shigeo"},{"family":"Tanikawa","given":"Tomohiro"},{"family":"Mimura","given":"Masaru"},{"family":"Kishimoto","given":"Taishiro"}],"citation-key":"horigomeModificationTherapistsFacial2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1030050","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1030050","PMCID":"PMC10225735","PMID":"37255521","source":"PubMed","title":"Modification of the therapist's facial expressions using virtual reality technology during the treatment of social anxiety disorder: a case series","title-short":"Modification of the therapist's facial expressions using virtual reality technology during the treatment of social anxiety disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

Avatar therapy (AT) allows patients to interact with a three-dimensional representation of their most distressing voices in a virtual reality setting. The therapy shows promise in reducing impairments and improving quality of life through the establishment of a therapeutic alliance and the exploration of dyadic interactions (verbal exchanges) between patients and their avatar. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in dyadic interactions throughout the immersive sessions of AT and to clarify the relationship between these interactions and therapeutic success by analyzing dyads as predictive indicators of positive outcomes in AT.\nMETHOD: Mean frequencies for the 10 most prevalent dyads identified in previous AT research were reported for 35 patients. A logistic regression model was implemented, and these dyads were used to predict variances in Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales-auditory hallucination scores 1 month after the completion of AT.\nRESULTS: Variances in mean frequencies were reported for the dyads. A positive relation between the avatar (provocation)-patient (self-affirmation) dyad and the therapeutic outcome was found to be significant (OR=2.29, p=0.049).\nCONCLUSION: This research is pioneering in its in-depth examination of therapeutic interactions in AT, with a particular focus on dyadic interactions.

Extant studies of DMHIs among adults suggest that participants' satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance are closely tied to engagement. However, these associations have not been investigated among children and adolescents involved in DMHIs.\nOBJECTIVE: To address these gaps in extant DMHI research, the purpose of this study was to (1) develop and implement a measure to assess satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance among children and adolescents participating in a DMHI and (2) investigate satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and therapeutic alliance as correlates of children's and adolescents' engagement in the DMHI.\nMETHODS: Members (children and adolescents) of a pediatric DMHI who had completed at least one session with a care provider (eg, coach or therapist) were eligible for inclusion in the study. Adolescent members and caregivers of children completed a survey assessing satisfaction with service, perceived usefulness of care, and therapeutic alliance with care team members.\nRESULTS: This study provides evidence for the reliability and validity of an adolescent- and caregiver-reported user experience assessment in a pediatric DMHI. Moreover, our findings suggest that adolescents' and caregivers' satisfaction and perceived usefulness are salient correlates of youths' engagement with a DMHI.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable preliminary evidence that caregivers' satisfaction and perceived usefulness are salient correlates of youths' engagement with a DMHI. Although further research is required, these findings offer preliminary evidence that caregivers play a critical role in effectively increasing engagement among children and adolescents involved in DMHIs.","author":[{"family":"Huffman","given":"Landry"},{"family":"Lawrence-Sidebottom","given":"Darian"},{"family":"Huberty","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Beatty","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Roots","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Roots","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Parikh","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Guerra","given":"Rachael"}],"citation-key":"huffmanSatisfactionPerceivedUsefulness2023","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/49384","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"e49384","PMCID":"PMC10512110","PMID":"37672321","source":"PubMed","title":"Satisfaction, Perceived Usefulness, and Therapeutic Alliance as Correlates of Participant Engagement in a Pediatric Digital Mental Health Intervention: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study","title-short":"Satisfaction, Perceived Usefulness, and Therapeutic Alliance as Correlates of Participant Engagement in a Pediatric Digital Mental Health Intervention","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

However, in the context of working with autistic adults, the relationship appears to be de-emphasized, or \"different approaches\" are recommended without specifying these. Neglect of relationship building may contribute to autistic adults' negative experiences with health care professionals identified in previous studies.\nMETHODS: I interviewed 17 autistic adults about their relationship building experiences with a wide range of professionals primarily from mental and medical health backgrounds. I also interviewed two mental health counselors and one psychologist who had experience working with this client group and had been recommended by autistic participants. I elicited best practice recommendations from all participants. I analyzed the data in an interpretive-interactionist framework and present them through creative analytic practice.\nFINDINGS: I address one major theme in this article: the importance of Rogerian/person-centered relationship conditions. All had to be practiced in an enhanced way: (1) Enhanced congruence could be demonstrated through therapist self-disclosure and refraining from phony relationship building \"techniques\" such as vocal adjustments. (2) Enhanced empathy could be demonstrated through genuine listening and accurate interpretation; however, interpretation needed to be phrased tentatively. (3) Enhanced unconditional positive regard could be demonstrated through explicit verbal expression, practical demonstration, and remembering.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results largely mirrored research with non-autistic populations: different approaches were not needed for relationship building.

  {"id":"hunikExploringPsychometricProperties2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The therapeutic alliance is a framework from psychology that describes three components: goals, tasks, and bond. The Working Alliance Inventory adapted for general practice (WAI-GP) measures the strength of the therapeutic alliance between the patient and the clinician, and it could be useful in both research and clinical settings.\nAIM: To determine if the patient score on WAI-GP can delineate the three components (goals, tasks, and bond), and to test concurrent validity with the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure and the Patient Perception of Patient-Centredness (PPPC) measure.\nDESIGN & SETTING: A cross-sectional study took place in 12 general practice waiting rooms in Australia.\nMETHOD: The research instruments included the 12-item WAI-GP (the patient version), the CARE and PPPC measures, plus a survey of demographics and reason for consultation. To perform a principal components factor analysis of the WAI-GP, this dataset was combined with an existing dataset. The Spearman rank correlation was used to determine concurrent validity between the WAI-GP and the CARE and PPPC measures.\nRESULTS: Participants (97-99%) reported a strong positive alliance after the consultation (average WAI-GP mean 4.27 ± 0.67 out of 5, n = 146).

Although such services can improve access for underserved populations, they may also present unique challenges, especially for refugee newcomers. This study examined the multidimensional nature of access to virtual mental health (VMH) care for refugee newcomers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using Levesque et al.'s Client-Centered Framework for Assessing Access to Health Care. One hundred and eight structured and semi structured interviews were conducted in four Canadian provinces (8 community leaders, 37 newcomer clients, 63 mental health or service providers or managers). Deductive qualitative analysis, based on the Client-Centered Framework, identified several overarching themes: challenges due to the cost and complexity of using technology; comfort for VMH outside clinical settings; sustainability post-COVID-19; and communication and the therapeutic alliance. Mental health organizations, community organizations, and service providers can improve access to (virtual) mental health care for refugee newcomers by addressing cultural and structural barriers, tailoring services, and offering choice and flexibility to newcomers.","author":[{"family":"Hynie","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Jaimes","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Oda","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rivest-Beauregard","given":"Marjolaine"},{"family":"Perez Gonzalez","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Ives","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Farah"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Ben C.

  {"id":"jongebloed-westraAttitudesExperiencesApplication2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Podiatrists are key professionals in promoting adequate foot self-care for people with diabetes at high-risk of developing foot ulcers. However, merely informing patients about the advantages of foot self-care is insufficient to realise behavioural change. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a promising person-centred communication style that could help to create a working alliance between healthcare providers and patient to improve foot self-care. This study aims to observe and analyse the application of MI in consultations carried out by MI-trained and non-MI-trained podiatrists with their patients, and explore podiatrists' attitudes and experiences towards MI.\nMETHODS: Eighteen podiatrists (median age: 28.5 years, 10 female and 8 male) followed a three-day basic training in MI and 4 podiatrists (median age: 38.5 years, 4 female) were not trained in MI. To observe and rate the MI-fidelity in daily clinical practice, audio recordings from the MI-trained and non-MI-trained podiatrists were scored with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity code. Individual, semi-structed, in-depth interviews were conducted with the MI-trained podiatrists to explore their attitudes towards and experiences with MI. These data sources were triangulated to describe the effect of training podiatrists in MI for their clinical practice.\nRESULTS: The MI-trained podiatrists scored significantly higher than the non-MI-trained podiatrists on two of four global MI-related communication skills (empathy, p = 0.008 and change talk, p = 0.008), on one of five core MI-adherent behaviours (affirmation, p = 0.041) and on one of the other behaviour counts (simple reflections, p = 0.008). The podiatrists mainly reported their attitudes and experiences regarding partnership and cultivating change talk, during the interviews. In addition, they also mentioned facilitators and barriers to using MI and indicated whether they experienced MI as having added value.\nCONCLUSIONS: The MI-trained podiatrists used the principles of MI at a solid beginner proficiency level in their clinical practice in comparison to the non-MI-trained podiatrists, who did not reach this level. This achievement is in accordance with the basic MI-training they received. This multi-method study reveals that podiatrists can be effectively trained in applying MI in daily clinical practice.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NL7710.

  {"id":"kaliItsNotJust2023","abstract":"Mentoring is one of the unique forms of rehabilitation used to engage with women in the sex trade. The role creates personal and professional challenges; one concerns the mentors themselves dealing with a past in the sex trade, embodying within it a sign of social disgrace. Echoing the concept of the \"wounded healer,\" the present study examines how mentors who are sex trade survivors perceive their role in supporting the rehabilitation of women in the sex trade and the meanings that they give it. The research is based on a qualitative approach from a critical-feminist point of view. Eight female mentors and sex trade survivors, working in different settings, participated in the study. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Based on content analysis, the study points to four components of mentoring vis-à-vis the rehabilitation of women in the sex trade: (1) mutual identification and shared destiny; (2) corrective experience; (3) hope; and (4) saving lives. In addition, mentoring serves as a bridge for the mentors, eliciting opportunities for growth transforming out of their pain. The research findings are discussed in the context of the theoretical framework of critical mentoring, and how a relationship and a therapeutic alliance can turn mentoring into a critical healing practice, in relation to four principles: (1) equality; (2) critical empathy; (3) recognition; and (4) solidarity.

  {"id":"kallaUnderstandingExperiencesTelehealth2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the era of online health care delivery, including within community palliative care. This study was part of a larger project involving a collaboration between universities, health care services, government agencies, and software developers that sought to enhance an existing telehealth (video call) platform with additional features to improve both patient and health care professional (HCP) experience in a palliative care context.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand palliative care patients' and HCPs' experiences of telehealth delivery in a palliative care context in Victoria, Australia. For the purposes of this study, telehealth included consultations by both video and telephone calls. By better understanding users' experiences and perceptions of telehealth, we hoped to determine users' preferences for new telehealth enhancement features.\nMETHODS: A total of 6 health care professionals and 6 patients were recruited from a major tertiary hospital network's palliative care unit in Victoria, Australia. Participants were asked to generate 3-5 photographs depicting their telehealth experiences. These photographs were used as visual aids to prompt discussion during subsequent one-on-one interviews. Intertextual analysis was conducted to identify key themes.\nRESULTS: A total of 3 overarching themes emerged: comfort (or lack thereof) afforded by telehealth, connection considerations in telehealth, and care quality impacts of telehealth. Patients (n=6) described telehealth as supporting their physical and psychological comfort and maintaining connection with HCPs, yet there were specific situations where it failed to meet their needs or impacted care quality and delayed treatment. HCPs (n=6) recognized the benefit of telehealth for patients but reported several limitations of telehealth, in particular due to lack of physical examination opportunities. Participants indicated that 2 types of connection were imperative for effective telehealth delivery: technical connection (eg, good internet connectivity or clear phone line) and interpersonal connection (ie, good rapport and therapeutic alliance between the HCPs and patients). Often technical connection issues impeded the development of interpersonal connection between the HCPs and patients in telehealth.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings presented in this study combined with other co-design activities, which are outside the scope of this paper, indicated the potential value of a telehealth enhancement feature that generates patient-facing clinical consultation summaries. Our team has developed a video telehealth enhancement feature (or \"add-on\"), which will enable clinicians to distill key actionable advice and self-management guidance discussed during teleconsultations for a take-home summary document for patients. The add-on's prototype has also been subjected to an initial simulation study, which will be reported in a future publication.","author":[{"family":"Kalla","given":"Mahima"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Hoda","given":"Rashina"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Parker","given":"Catriona"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Michael Edward"},{"family":"Georgy","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Huckvale","given":"Kit"},{"family":"Bain","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Poon","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"kallaUnderstandingExperiencesTelehealth2025","container-title":"JMIR human factors","container-title-short":"JMIR Hum Factors","DOI":"10.2196/53913","ISSN":"2292-9495","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"language":"eng","page":"e53913","PMCID":"PMC11835783","PMID":"39935022","source":"PubMed","title":"Understanding Experiences of Telehealth in Palliative Care: Photo Interview Study","title-short":"Understanding Experiences of Telehealth in Palliative Care","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"kampAdditionalValueSelfreflection2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Over the past few decades, psychotherapy research was dominated by testing the efficacy of \"brand name\" therapeutic techniques and models. Another line of research however, suggests that common factors, such as the therapeutic alliance and empathy, might play a greater role in effective therapy than specific therapeutic techniques and models. Routine process monitoring (RPM), focusing on common factors, has emerged as a promising approach to enhance therapy outcomes. This ongoing feedback loop aims to improve the therapeutic alliance and to address countertransference issues, potentially leading to better therapy outcomes.\nMETHODS: A total of 131 patients above the age of 18 were included into the sample. The design of the study consisted of three stages, in which two kinds of instruments to measure the therapeutic alliance and countertransference were administered, namely the Session Rating Scale (SRS) and a brief version of Impact Message Inventory-Circumplex (IMI-CS). The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) was used as an outcome measure. Depending on the stage of the study, these three instruments were administered every time a patient had a psychotherapy session.\nRESULTS: Patients reported improved outcomes on the ORS in T2 compared to T1 (p = 0.011). Furthermore, a significant increase in the strength of the therapeutic relationship, as measured by the SRS, occurred between T2 and T3 (p = 0.031). A positive correlation was found between SRS scores and the \"friendly\" position on the IMI-CS (p = <0.000), while a negative correlation was found between SRS ratings and the \"submissive\" position on the IMI-CS (p = 0.019).\nDISCUSSION: Patients experienced improvements and might attribute part of their improvement to the relationship with their therapists, evaluating the therapeutic alliance more positively in the later stages of their treatment. Despite methodological challenges, such as varying treatment durations and pre-existing therapist-patient relationships, the findings highlight the value of patient engagement and therapist self-reflection. This study supports the utility of deliberate practice in psychotherapy, suggesting it can enhance therapeutic outcome and laying the groundwork for future research.","author":[{"family":"Kamp","given":"David"},{"family":"Blanker","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"Hafkenscheid","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Os","given":"Jim","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"kampAdditionalValueSelfreflection2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1451251","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1451251","PMCID":"PMC11700981","PMID":"39764076","source":"PubMed","title":"The additional value of self-reflection and feedback on therapy outcome: a pilot study","title-short":"The additional value of self-reflection and feedback on therapy outcome","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"kashefiTalesHopeHesitation2025","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Smoking remains a global health challenge, with 1.14 billion active smokers worldwide. Many of these smokers seek cessation support. The rise of mHealth offers novel intervention methods, providing monitoring and tailored feedback. This study aimed to map the opportunities and challenges of integrating digital behaviour change interventions (mHealth) into smoking cessation practices by understanding professionals' perceptions of these tools.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study was conducted involving semi-structured interviews with 11 experienced smoking cessation professionals in Flanders, Belgium. Data collection occurred between January and April 2023. Inductive thematic analysis was performed to identify key patterns and themes in the experts' views regarding mHealth interventions.\nRESULTS: The analysis revealed four primary themes: (1) The Inexorable March of Technology - experts acknowledged the inevitability of technology in smoking cessation but varied in enthusiasm; (2) The Shimmering Mirage of Possibility - technology was viewed as supplementary, offering efficiency and support but limited in depth; (3) The Footnotes to Enthusiasm - experts expressed concerns over privacy, inclusivity, and the potential for technology to displace human care; and (4) The Human Anchor - the irreplaceable role of human connection and therapeutic alliance, which digital tools might not be able to replicate.\nCONCLUSION: Experts believe mHealth interventions can augment smoking cessation support but should not replace human-driven care. A blended approach, integrating digital tools with traditional therapeutic relationships, offers the most promise. Addressing concerns about privacy, inclusivity, and most importantly the limits of digital therapeutic alliances is essential for successful mHealth implementation in smoking cessation.","author":[{"family":"Kashefi","given":"Arian"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Stephen Lee"},{"family":"De Marez","given":"Lieven"},{"family":"Conradie","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Vanden Abeele","given":"Mariek M.

Communication approaches used by pediatric oncologists to foster therapeutic alliance with children with cancer and their families are not well understood.\nOBJECTIVES: To identify key oncologist-driven facilitators associated with building and sustaining therapeutic alliance in the setting of advancing pediatric cancer and to develop a framework to guide clinical practice and future investigation of therapeutic alliance.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, serial disease reevaluation discussions that occurred in the clinic, inpatient hospital, or off campus via telephone were recorded among pediatric oncologists, patients with high-risk cancer, and their families across 24 months or until death, whichever occurred first, from 2016 to 2020. This analysis focused on recorded discussions for pediatric patients who experienced progressive disease during the study period. Content analysis was conducted across recorded dialogue to derive inductive codes and identify themes. Participants were patient-parent dyads for whom a primary oncologist projected the patient's survival to be 50% or less, all family members and friends who attended any of their recorded disease reevaluation conversations, and their oncologists and other clinicians who attended the recorded discussions.\nRESULTS: A total of 33 patient-parent dyads were enrolled and followed longitudinally. From this cohort, 17 patients experienced disease progression during the study period, most of whom were female (11 [64.7%]) and White (15 [88.2%]) individuals. For these patients, 141 disease reevaluation discussions were audio recorded, comprising 2400 minutes of medical dialogue. Most children (14 [82.4%]) died during the study period. A median of 7 disease reevaluation discussions per patient (range, 1-19) were recorded. Content analysis yielded 28 unique concepts associated with therapeutic alliance fostered by oncologist communication. Ultimately, 7 core themes emerged to support a framework for clinician approaches associated with optimizing therapeutic alliance: human connection, empathy, presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, pediatric oncologists used diverse communication approaches associated with building and deepening connections across advancing illness. These findings offer a framework to support clinical and research strategies for strengthening therapeutic alliance among pediatric oncologists, patients, and families.","author":[{"family":"Kaye","given":"Erica C."},{"family":"Rockwell","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Cameka"},{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Monica E."},{"family":"Andes","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Justin N."},{"family":"Mack","given":"Jennifer W."}],"citation-key":"kayeFacilitatorsAssociatedBuilding2021","container-title":"JAMA network open","container-title-short":"JAMA Netw Open","DOI":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.20925","ISSN":"2574-3805","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"e2120925","PMCID":"PMC8379655","PMID":"34415315","source":"PubMed","title":"Facilitators Associated With Building and Sustaining Therapeutic Alliance in Advanced Pediatric Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"khawajaYourRobotTherapist2023","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots have the potential to substantially increase access to affordable and effective mental health services by supplementing the work of clinicians. Their 24/7 availability and accessibility through a mobile phone allow individuals to obtain help whenever and wherever needed, overcoming financial and logistical barriers. Although psychological AI chatbots have the ability to make significant improvements in providing mental health care services, they do not come without ethical and technical challenges. Some major concerns include providing inadequate or harmful support, exploiting vulnerable populations, and potentially producing discriminatory advice due to algorithmic bias. However, it is not always obvious for users to fully understand the nature of the relationship they have with chatbots. There can be significant misunderstandings about the exact purpose of the chatbot, particularly in terms of care expectations, ability to adapt to the particularities of users and responsiveness in terms of the needs and resources/treatments that can be offered. Hence, it is imperative that users are aware of the limited therapeutic relationship they can enjoy when interacting with mental health chatbots. Ignorance or misunderstanding of such limitations or of the role of psychological AI chatbots may lead to a therapeutic misconception (TM) where the user would underestimate the restrictions of such technologies and overestimate their ability to provide actual therapeutic support and guidance. TM raises major ethical concerns that can exacerbate one's mental health contributing to the global mental health crisis. This paper will explore the various ways in which TM can occur particularly through inaccurate marketing of these chatbots, forming a digital therapeutic alliance with them, receiving harmful advice due to bias in the design and algorithm, and the chatbots inability to foster autonomy with patients.","author":[{"family":"Khawaja","given":"Zoha"},{"family":"Bélisle-Pipon","given":"Jean-Christophe"}],"citation-key":"khawajaYourRobotTherapist2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Health","container-title-short":"Front Digit Health","DOI":"10.3389/fdgth.2023.1278186","ISSN":"2673-253X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1278186","PMCID":"PMC10663264","PMID":"38026836","source":"PubMed","title":"Your robot therapist is not your therapist: understanding the role of AI-powered mental health chatbots","title-short":"Your robot therapist is not your therapist","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

This study aimed to describe the experiences and feedback from participants with opioid use disorder enrolled in a text-message intervention in Kenya. Qualitative data was collected from participants in the intervention arm of a feasibility trial testing a text-message intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy. Data was collected using open-ended questions in a questionnaire and structured in-depth interviews amongst those who received the intervention. Framework method was applied for analysis. Twenty-four participants (83.3% males) were enrolled with a mean age of 32.5 years (SD9.5). Five themes were identified namely: (1) Gain of cognitive behavioral therapy skills which included: identification and change of substance use patterns; drug refusal skills; coping with craving and self-efficacy; (2) Therapeutic alliance which included: development of a bond and agreement on treatment goals; (3) Feedback on intervention components and delivery such as: frequency, and duration of the text message intervention; (4) Challenges experienced during the intervention such as: technical problems with phones; and barriers related to intervention delivery; (5) Recommendations for improvement of intervention in future implementations. The findings demonstrated participants' satisfaction with intervention, gain of skills to change substance use patterns, highlighted challenges experienced and suggestions on improving the intervention among individuals with opioid use disorder.

  {"id":"kleinbubPhysiologicalSynchronizationInnovative2025","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Interpersonal synchronization is increasingly studied as a biomarker of empathy, therapeutic alliance, and treatment outcome. However, most studies average data over sessions, leaving associations between synchrony and actual interactions largely unexplored. We aim to showcase a novel approach examining synchronization during specific micro-processes: Innovative Moments (IM) as markers of exceptions to clients' problematic patterns of meaning.\nMETHODS: Electrodermal activity was recorded over 15 sessions of a psychodynamic psychotherapy single case. Moment-to-moment patient-therapist synchrony was calculated using the Adaptive Matching Interpolated Correlations (AMICo) algorithm. The Innovative Moments Coding System was utilized to identify IMs within session transcripts with precise timing. Monte-Carlo permutation tests were conducted to examine the association between physiological synchrony and IM Levels of increasing complexity (Levels 1-3).\nRESULTS: Higher-than-random synchronization emerged during Level 3 IMs (p = 0.046; d = 0.21) but not in lower Levels. Post-hoc qualitative analyses linked high synchrony to sub-processes of Level 3 IMs, such as positive contrasts and attributions for change.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings show it is possible to link moment-by-moment physiological co-regulation to theoretically identified meaning-making processes. While generalization of these observations is undue, this work demonstrates a robust and promising application of a multimodal approach to investigating psychotherapy, providing insights into both the clinical case and the theoretical model adopted.","author":[{"family":"Kleinbub","given":"Johann R."},{"family":"Esposito","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Cutolo","given":"Anna S."},{"family":"Palmieri","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Miguel M."}],"citation-key":"kleinbubPhysiologicalSynchronizationInnovative2025","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research: Journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","container-title-short":"Psychother Res","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2024.2352752","ISSN":"1468-4381","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"223-238","PMID":"38754031","source":"PubMed","title":"Physiological synchronization and innovative moments in psychotherapy: A single-case study of micro-process","title-short":"Physiological synchronization and innovative moments in psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"kleinbubRMEAPackageAssess2021","abstract":"Introduction. Motion Energy Analysis (MEA) is a procedure that allows to automatically assess the amount of persons' movement from video recordings. Recent studies used MEA to investigate nonverbal synchrony, i.e., the occurrence of simultaneous movement, suggesting the existence of an association with relationship quality. In patient-therapist dyads, synchrony predicted therapeutic alliance, empathy, as well as treatment outcome. Package description. The article presents rMEA, an open-source R package that allows to import, filter, and visualize dyadic time-series of nonverbal behaviour generated by other MEA software. The package includes a fast, state-of-the-art, moving window cross-correlation algorithm with lag analysis, which provides a user-friendly interface for the assessment of nonverbal synchrony. Through the analysis of a motivating example (40 psychotherapy intake interviews split between dropouts and good cases) the article provides an in-depth description of the package main functions and a tutorial for a typical analysis in this field, requiring only the most basic knowledge of the R language and environment. The rich visualization capabilities of the software provide powerful tools for the various steps involved in the diagnostics, analysis, interpretation and publication of these data. Conclusions. Overall, the paper aims to empower psychotherapy researchers and other interaction scientists to investigate nonverbal synchrony in their own dyads.","author":[{"family":"Kleinbub","given":"Johann R."},{"family":"Ramseyer","given":"Fabian T."}],"citation-key":"kleinbubRMEAPackageAssess2021","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research: Journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","container-title-short":"Psychother Res","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2020.1844334","ISSN":"1468-4381","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"817-830","PMID":"33225873","source":"PubMed","title":"rMEA: An R package to assess nonverbal synchronization in motion energy analysis time-series","title-short":"rMEA","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"kohneTherapeuticRelationshipEHealthA2020","abstract":"eHealth programs have been found to be effective in treating many psychological conditions. Regarding Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), few programs have been tested; nevertheless, results are promising. The therapeutic alliance is an important factor predicting treatment outcome in BPD. However, we do not know yet to what extent BPD patients form a therapeutic alliance with an eHealth tool and how this relationship differs from the relationship with their human therapist. This study aims to address this question using priovi, an interactive schema therapy-based eHealth tool for BPD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how patients perceived the therapeutic alliance with priovi and its differences compared to the alliance with their human therapist (N = 9). Interview data were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) was administered in two versions (regarding the human therapist and priovi, N = 16) every three months during the treatment phase of one year. Results indicate that patients were able to form a good therapeutic relationship with priovi, but it differed from the relationship to their human therapist. Important categories were \"priovi is helpful, supportive and always there\" and \"priovi is less flexible\". WAI ratings for the task subscale were high in both relationships but significantly higher in WAItherapist compared to WAIpriovi in two measurements (nine-months measurement: t = 2.76, df = 15, p = 0.015; twelve-months measurement: t = 3.44, df = 15, p = 0.004). These results indicate that BPD patients can form a functioning alliance with an eHealth program and that eHealth programs may be especially useful for psychoeducation and cognitive exercises.","author":[{"family":"Köhne","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Schweiger","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Gitta A."},{"family":"Braakmann","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Jan Philipp"},{"family":"Borgwardt","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Assmann","given":"Nele"},{"family":"Rogg","given":"Mirco"},{"family":"Schaich","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Faßbinder","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"kohneTherapeuticRelationshipEHealthA2020","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph17176436","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"6436","PMCID":"PMC7504280","PMID":"32899432","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapeutic Relationship in eHealth-A Pilot Study of Similarities and Differences between the Online Program Priovi and Therapists Treating Borderline Personality Disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"kongVirtualVolunteeringCOVID192022","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the healthcare sector in many ways. Social safety measures in hospices in Singapore include cessation of non-essential services such as volunteering. Literature shows that volunteers are valuable in enhancing the quality of life of patients in receiving hospice services. They provide patients with needed companionship, and meaningful activities such as bringing their pets into the wards in animal-assisted activities. The rise of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic brought an increasing interest in virtual volunteering such as virtual animal-assisted activities (VAAA). However, there is currently a lack of literature on virtual volunteering as its increased demand is a recent trend. Virtual volunteering in a hospice in Singapore is described through two retrospective case studies of VAAA. These case studies showed that a therapeutic alliance can be effectively built via virtual platforms. Benefits of virtual volunteering include enabling continued service delivery and increased comfort for some patients as virtual interactions can be less intimidating as compared to interacting with an animal in real life. Virtual volunteering may be considered to complement face-to-face volunteering in end-of-life care as part of normal practice.","author":[{"family":"Kong","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Soon","given":"Shu Min Camellia"}],"citation-key":"kongVirtualVolunteeringCOVID192022","container-title":"Journal of Social Work in End-of-Life & Palliative Care","container-title-short":"J Soc Work End Life Palliat Care","DOI":"10.1080/15524256.2022.2105472","ISSN":"1552-4264","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"203-215","PMID":"35913806","source":"PubMed","title":"Virtual volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic: case studies of virtual animal-assisted activities in a Singapore hospice","title-short":"Virtual volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"kopkaExploringHowInformed2023","abstract":"The prevalence of mental health app use by people suffering from mental health disorders is rapidly growing. The integration of mental health apps shows promise in increasing the accessibility and quality of treatment. However, a lack of continued engagement is one of the significant challenges of such implementation. In response, the M-health Index and Navigation Database (MIND)- derived from the American Psychiatric Association's app evaluation framework- was created to support patient autonomy and enhance engagement. This study aimed to identify factors influencing engagement with mental health apps and explore how MIND may affect user engagement around selected apps. We conducted a longitudinal online survey over six weeks after participants were instructed to find mental health apps using MIND. The survey included demographic information, technology usage, access to healthcare, app selection information, System Usability Scale, the Digital Working Alliance Inventory, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale questions. Quantitative analysis was performed to analyze the data. A total of 321 surveys were completed (178 at the initial, 90 at the 2-week mark, and 53 at the 6-week mark). The most influential factors when choosing mental health apps included cost (76%), condition supported by the app (59%), and app features offered (51%), while privacy and clinical foundation to support app claims were among the least selected filters. The top ten apps selected by participants were analyzed for engagement. Rates of engagement among the top-ten apps decreased by 43% from the initial to week two and 22% from week two to week six on average. In the context of overall low engagement with mental health apps, implementation of mental health app databases like MIND can play an essential role in maintaining higher engagement and satisfaction. Together, this study offers early data on how educational approaches like MIND may help bolster mental health apps engagement.","author":[{"family":"Kopka","given":"Marvin"},{"family":"Camacho","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Torous","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"kopkaExploringHowInformed2023","container-title":"PLOS digital health","container-title-short":"PLOS Digit Health","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pdig.0000219","ISSN":"2767-3170","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"e0000219","PMCID":"PMC10058075","PMID":"36989237","source":"PubMed","title":"Exploring how informed mental health app selection may impact user engagement and satisfaction","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"kowatschConversationalAgentsMediating2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Successful management of chronic diseases requires a trustful collaboration between health care professionals, patients, and family members. Scalable conversational agents, designed to assist health care professionals, may play a significant role in supporting this collaboration in a scalable way by reaching out to the everyday lives of patients and their family members. However, to date, it remains unclear whether conversational agents, in such a role, would be accepted and whether they can support this multistakeholder collaboration.\nOBJECTIVE: With asthma in children representing a relevant target of chronic disease management, this study had the following objectives: (1) to describe the design of MAX, a conversational agent-delivered asthma intervention that supports health care professionals targeting child-parent teams in their everyday lives; and (2) to assess the (a) reach of MAX, (b) conversational agent-patient working alliance, (c) acceptance of MAX, (d) intervention completion rate, (e) cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and (f) human effort and responsiveness of health care professionals in primary and secondary care settings.\nMETHODS: MAX was designed to increase cognitive skills (ie, knowledge about asthma) and behavioral skills (ie, inhalation technique) in 10-15-year-olds with asthma, and enables support by a health professional and a family member. To this end, three design goals guided the development: (1) to build a conversational agent-patient working alliance; (2) to offer hybrid (human- and conversational agent-supported) ubiquitous coaching; and (3) to provide an intervention with high experiential value. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, asthma experts, and young patients with their parents developed the intervention collaboratively. The conversational agent communicates with health care professionals via email, with patients via a mobile chat app, and with a family member via SMS text messaging. A single-arm feasibility study in primary and secondary care settings was performed to assess MAX.\nRESULTS: Results indicated an overall positive evaluation of MAX with respect to its reach (49.5%, 49/99 of recruited and eligible patient-family member teams participated), a strong patient-conversational agent working alliance, and high acceptance by all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, MAX led to improved cognitive and behavioral skills and an intervention completion rate of 75.5%. Family members supported the patients in 269 out of 275 (97.8%) coaching sessions. Most of the conversational turns (99.5%) were conducted between patients and the conversational agent as opposed to between patients and health care professionals, thus indicating the scalability of MAX. In addition, it took health care professionals less than 4 minutes to assess the inhalation technique and 3 days to deliver related feedback to the patients. Several suggestions for improvement were made.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that conversational agents, designed as mediating social actors involving health care professionals, patients, and family members, are not only accepted in such a \"team player\" role but also show potential to improve health-relevant outcomes in chronic disease management.","author":[{"family":"Kowatsch","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Schachner","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Harperink","given":"Samira"},{"family":"Barata","given":"Filipe"},{"family":"Dittler","given":"Ullrich"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Grace"},{"family":"Stanger","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"V Wangenheim","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Fleisch","given":"Elgar"},{"family":"Oswald","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Möller","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"kowatschConversationalAgentsMediating2021","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/25060","ISSN":"1438-8871","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,17]]},"language":"eng","page":"e25060","PMCID":"PMC7929753","PMID":"33484114","source":"PubMed","title":"Conversational Agents as Mediating Social Actors in Chronic Disease Management Involving Health Care Professionals, Patients, and Family Members: Multisite Single-Arm Feasibility Study","title-short":"Conversational Agents as Mediating Social Actors in Chronic Disease Management Involving Health Care Professionals, Patients, and Family Members","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"krasovskyHybridApproachesAllied2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hybrid models that integrate both in-person and remote health services are increasingly recognized as a promising approach. Nevertheless, research that defines and characterizes these models in children and young people is scarce and essential for establishing guidelines for implementation of hybrid allied health services. This scoping review evaluates four key aspects of hybrid allied health services in children and young people: 1. definitions, 2. service characteristics, 3. outcome measures, and 4. results of hybrid allied health services.\nMETHODS: Six databases were searched: Medline (Ovid), Embase, CINHAL, Psycinfo, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Of the 9,868 studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria, 49 studies focused on children and young people. Following full-text review, n = 21 studies were included.\nRESULTS: Terminology used for hybrid allied health services varied across studies which targeted diverse clinical populations and varied in study design, type and frequency of remote and in-person treatments. Over 75% of cases used custom-written software, limiting scalability. All interventions started in-person, possibly to establish a therapeutic alliance and solve technological issues. Most hybrid allied health services (67%) were in mental health, while only a minority involved physical, occupational or speech therapy. The most common outcomes were feasibility and satisfaction, but tools used to measure them were inconsistent. Although 57% of studies demonstrated effectiveness of hybrid allied health services, none measured cost-effectiveness.\nDISCUSSION: Despite the potential of hybrid allied health services for children and young people, the literature remains at a preliminary stage. Standardization of definitions and outcome measures, and clearer reporting of service characteristics and results would likely promote consolidation of hybrid allied health services in children and young people into clinical practice.","author":[{"family":"Krasovsky","given":"Tal"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Patrice L."},{"family":"Gafni-Lachter","given":"Liat"},{"family":"Kizony","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Gefen","given":"Naomi"}],"citation-key":"krasovskyHybridApproachesAllied2024","container-title":"Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation","container-title-short":"J Neuroeng Rehabil","DOI":"10.1186/s12984-024-01401-1","ISSN":"1743-0003","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,19]]},"language":"eng","page":"122","PMCID":"PMC11264746","PMID":"39030627","source":"PubMed","title":"Hybrid approaches to allied health services for children and young people: a scoping review","title-short":"Hybrid approaches to allied health services for children and young people","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"kuhnElicitingPerspectivesRemote2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The transition towards remote healthcare has been rapidly accelerated in recent years due to a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, however, few studies have explored service users' views of remote mental healthcare, particularly in community mental health settings.\nMETHODS: As part of a larger study concerned with the development of a remotely delivered psychosocial intervention, a survey was conducted with service users with psychosis (N = 200) from six NHS trusts across England to gain cross-sectional data about service users' opinions and attitudes towards remote interventions and explore how digital access varies across different demographic groups and geographical localities.\nRESULTS: The majority of service users had access to technological devices and a quiet space to receive care. Age was a key factor in motivation to engage with remote care as older participants had less access to technological devices and the internet, and reported less confidence to learn how to use new technologies compared to younger participants. Differences in access and attitudes towards remote care were found across the different geographical localities. Over half of the participants (53.1%) preferred a hybrid model (i.e., mixture of face-to-face and remotely delivered treatment), with only 4.5% preferring remote treatment exclusively. Factors that both encourage and deter service users from engaging with remote care were identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide important information about the environmental and clinical barriers that prevent, or limit, the uptake of remotely delivered care for people with psychotic disorders. Although service users often have the ability and capacity to receive remote care, providers need to be cognisant of factors which may exacerbate digital exclusion and negatively impact the therapeutic alliance.","author":[{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Ronja"},{"family":"Abdel-Halim","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Elliot","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"McNamee","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"kuhnElicitingPerspectivesRemote2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Health","container-title-short":"Front Digit Health","DOI":"10.3389/fdgth.2024.1304456","ISSN":"2673-253X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1304456","PMCID":"PMC10897019","PMID":"38414715","source":"PubMed","title":"Eliciting perspectives on remote healthcare delivery from service users with psychosis in the community: a cross-sectional survey study","title-short":"Eliciting perspectives on remote healthcare delivery from service users with psychosis in the community","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

While these therapeutics are prescribed and regulated like drugs, they lack an established pharmacologic framework to define how digital content is delivered, processed, and translated into clinical benefit. In this editorial, we draw on rich experience in drug and PDT development to introduce the emerging discipline of digital pharmacometrics: the application of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) principles to software-based medicine. We redefine classical concepts such as dose, exposure, and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) framework for the context of digital therapeutics and identify Digital Working Alliance (DWA) formation as a critical modulator of therapeutic bioavailability. We also characterize digital PD through the development of dose-exposure-response curves that capture behavioral, biometric, and clinical outcomes, enabling closed-loop, adaptive therapeutic systems. This digital PK/PD model supports better trial design, labeling clarity, regulatory oversight, clinical guidance, and reimbursement models. By formally codifying how PDTs interact with patients and produce effects, digital pharmacometrics provides the scientific foundation necessary to scale precision software medicine.","author":[{"family":"Lakhan","given":"Shaheen E."}],"citation-key":"lakhanIntroducingDigitalPharmacometrics2025","container-title":"Cureus","container-title-short":"Cureus","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.84195","ISSN":"2168-8184","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"e84195","PMCID":"PMC12083506","PMID":"40385249","source":"PubMed","title":"Introducing Digital Pharmacometrics: A Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) Framework for Prescription Digital Therapeutics","title-short":"Introducing Digital Pharmacometrics","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"lalkEmployingLargeLanguage2025","abstract":"PURPOSE: In the context of psychotherapy, emotions play an important role both through their association with symptom severity, as well as their effects on the therapeutic relationship. In this analysis, we aim to train a large language model (LLM) for the detection of emotions in German speech. We want to apply this model on a corpus of psychotherapy transcripts to predict symptom severity and alliance aiming to identify the most important emotions for the prediction of symptom severity and therapeutic alliance.\nMETHODS: We employed a public labeled dataset of 28 emotions and translated the dataset into German. A pre-trained LLM was then fine-tuned on this dataset for emotion classification. We applied the fine-tuned model to a dataset containing 553 psychotherapy sessions of 124 patients. Using machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI), we predicted symptom severity and alliance by the detected emotions.\nRESULTS: Our fine-tuned model achieved modest classification performance (F1macro =0.45, Accuracy=0.41, Kappa=0.42) across the 28 emotions. Incorporating all emotions, our ML model showed satisfying performance for the prediction of symptom severity (r = .50; 95%-CI:.42,.57) and moderate performance for the prediction of alliance scores (r = .20; 95%-CI:.06,.32). The most important emotions for the prediction of symptom severity were approval, anger, and fear. The most important emotions for the prediction of alliance were curiosity, confusion, and surprise.\nCONCLUSIONS: Even though the classification results were only moderate, our model achieved a good performance especially for prediction of symptom severity. The results confirm the role of negative emotions in the prediction of symptom severity, while they also highlight the role of positive emotions in fostering a good alliance. Future directions entail the improvement of the labeled dataset, especially with regards to domain-specificity and incorporating context information. Additionally, other modalities and Natural Language Processsing (NLP)-based alliance assessment could be integrated.","author":[{"family":"Lalk","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Targan","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Steinbrenner","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Schaffrath","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Eberhardt","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Vehlen","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Lutz","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Rubel","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"lalkEmployingLargeLanguage2025","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1504306","PMCID":"PMC12098529","PMID":"40417271","source":"PubMed","title":"Employing large language models for emotion detection in psychotherapy transcripts","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"lalkMeasuringAllianceSymptom2024","abstract":"We aim to use topic modeling, an approach for discovering clusters of related words (\"topics\"), to predict symptom severity and therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy transcripts, while also identifying the most important topics and overarching themes for prediction. We analyzed 552 psychotherapy transcripts from 124 patients. Using BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), we extracted 250 topics each for patient and therapist speech. These topics were used to predict symptom severity and alliance with various competing machine-learning methods. Sensitivity analyses were calculated for a model based on 50 topics, LDA-based topic modeling, and a bigram model. Additionally, we grouped topics into themes using qualitative analysis and identified key topics and themes with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Symptom severity could be predicted with highest accuracy by patient topics ( r =0.45, 95%-CI 0.40, 0.51), whereas alliance was better predicted by therapist topics ( r =0.20, 95%-CI 0.16, 0.24). Drivers for symptom severity were themes related to health and negative experiences. Lower alliance was correlated with various themes, especially psychotherapy framework, income, and everyday life. This analysis shows the potential of using topic modeling in psychotherapy research allowing to predict several treatment-relevant metrics with reasonable accuracy. Further, the use of XAI allows for an analysis of the individual predictive value of topics and themes. Limitations entail heterogeneity across different topic modeling hyperparameters and a relatively small sample size.","author":[{"family":"Lalk","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Steinbrenner","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kania","given":"Weronika"},{"family":"Popko","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Wester","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Schaffrath","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Eberhardt","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Lutz","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Rubel","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"lalkMeasuringAllianceSymptom2024","container-title":"Administration and Policy in Mental Health","container-title-short":"Adm Policy Ment Health","DOI":"10.1007/s10488-024-01356-4","ISSN":"1573-3289","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"509-524","PMCID":"PMC11196307","PMID":"38551767","source":"PubMed","title":"Measuring Alliance and Symptom Severity in Psychotherapy Transcripts Using Bert Topic Modeling","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

Studies suggest that family caregivers of cancer patients experience equal or greater levels of FCR than patients themselves. In the past 5 years, several interventions have demonstrated their ability to reduce FCR among cancer patients and in patient-caregiver dyads. However, to date, no intervention exists to individually target family caregiver's FCR. The aims of the proposed pilot study are to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the newly adapted Family Caregiver-Fear Of Recurrence Therapy (FC-FORT) intervention to inform a larger randomized control trial study, and (2) estimate the clinical significance of FC-FORT. Initial evaluation of FC-FORT revealed high user satisfaction and usability.\nMETHODS: A parallel, two-group, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing FC-FORT to a waitlist control (care as usual) will be conducted. Participant inclusion criteria are (a) women family caregivers taking care of adult cancer patients (no recurrence), (b) experiencing clinical levels of FCR, (c) access to a computer/internet connection, and (d) living in Canada. Participants (n = 36) will be recruited at Ottawa and Toronto hospitals, previous study participant pools, through social media and community partners across Canada. Participants in the intervention group will complete the FC-FORT intervention (7 consecutive weeks of virtual group therapy and homework). Participants in the control group will be offered the intervention after their participation in the study. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaire packages at baseline (T0), immediately post-intervention (7 weeks; T1) and at 3-months post-intervention (T2). Feasibility (e.g., recruitment, allocation, fidelity), acceptability (e.g., dropout, completion, satisfaction) and clinical significance of secondary outcomes will be evaluated (i.e., FCR illness uncertainty). Participants in the intervention group will be asked to complete measures of group cohesion and therapeutic alliance and take part in a semi-structured exit interview exploring their overall experience with FC-FORT.\nDISCUSSION: This project will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the newly adapted FC-FORT to inform a larger trial.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT, NCT05441384.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the experiences among patients and physiotherapists, of communication and interaction in digital, video-based physiotherapy.\nMETHODS: A qualitative interview study with a phenomenological approach was conducted. Participants were purposively recruited from primary health care clinics. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 physiotherapists and 6 patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a phenomenological approach.\nRESULTS: The analysis resulted in the overall theme Reaching for connection, which captured the central meaning of the participants' experiences. Four categories emerged from the analysis: 1) Closeness at a distance; 2) Overcoming limited bodily communication; 3) The technology as part of the meeting; and 4) Challenging the physical meeting as a norm. The results suggest that communication and interaction in digital settings differ from physical settings, but there is an ongoing adaptation process to this new paradigm.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that video-based physiotherapy, while having several benefits according to both patients and physiotherapists, affects the communication in several ways. Physiotherapists need to acknowledge these limitations and seek strategies to adapt and to compensate for the reduced non-verbal elements and lack of touch. Attention to the physical room and shifting between positions (face/full figure) are suggested practical strategies, but also to practice awareness and embodied communication to improve receptivity in the interaction.","author":[{"family":"Lange","given":"Elvira"},{"family":"Danielsson","given":"Louise"}],"citation-key":"langeReachingConnectionQualitative2024","container-title":"Physiotherapy Theory and Practice","container-title-short":"Physiother Theory Pract","DOI":"10.1080/09593985.2023.2296574","ISSN":"1532-5040","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"2865-2876","PMID":"38145499","source":"PubMed","title":"Reaching for connection: a qualitative study of communication and interaction in video-based physiotherapy","title-short":"Reaching for connection","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"leighInternetdeliveredTherapistassistedCognitive2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive therapy for SAD (CT-SAD) is a first-line recommended treatment for adult social anxiety disorder (SAD) and shows considerable promise for youth. However, the high prevalence of adolescent SAD and limited number of therapists presents an implementation challenge. Delivery of CT-SAD via the Internet may offer part of the solution.\nMETHOD: Forty-three youth (14-18 years) with SAD recruited through schools were randomly allocated to therapist-assisted Internet-delivered CT-SAD (called OSCA) or waitlist for 14 weeks (ISRCTN15079139).\nRESULTS: OSCA outperformed waitlist on all measures and was associated with large effects that were maintained at 6-month follow-up. In the OSCA arm, 77% of adolescents lost their SAD diagnosis at post (vs. 14% in the waitlist arm), increasing to 91% at 6-months. Beneficial effects of OSCA were mediated through changes in cognitions and safety behaviours as predicted by cognitive models of SAD. OSCA was associated with high credibility and therapeutic alliance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary trial suggests OSCA holds promise as an effective, accessible treatment for adolescent SAD. Future definitive trials could compare OSCA to active comparators to examine specificity of effects.","author":[{"family":"Leigh","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Clark","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"leighInternetdeliveredTherapistassistedCognitive2023","container-title":"Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines","container-title-short":"J Child Psychol Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1111/jcpp.13680","ISSN":"1469-7610","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"145-155","PMCID":"PMC10087225","PMID":"35943064","source":"PubMed","title":"Internet-delivered therapist-assisted cognitive therapy for adolescent social anxiety disorder (OSCA): a randomised controlled trial addressing preliminary efficacy and mechanisms of action","title-short":"Internet-delivered therapist-assisted cognitive therapy for adolescent social anxiety disorder (OSCA)","type":"article-journal","volume":"64"},
  {"id":"leijseUsingActivePassive2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Delinquent behavior in adolescence is a prevalent issue, often associated with difficulties across multiple life domains, which in turn perpetuates negative life outcomes. While current treatment programs show partial success in improving behavioral changes and reducing recidivism, comprehensive conclusions regarding the overall efficacy of these interventions have yet to be established. In forensic outpatient settings, the discrepancy between adolescents' limited emotional awareness and the predominant emphasis on cognitive reflection, combined with low treatment adherence, may be factors that undermine treatment efficacy. New technologies, such as smartphone apps, may offer a solution by integrating real-life data into treatment to improve emotional and behavioral patterns. The low-threshold use of smartphone data can be useful in addressing these treatment challenges.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the feasibility and usability of Feelee (Garage2020), a smartphone app that integrates active emoji and passive behavioral data, as a potential addition to treatment for adolescents in a forensic outpatient setting.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prepilot study with adolescents (n=4) who used the Feelee app over a 2-week period. App usage included completing a brief emoji survey 3 times a day (active data) and allowing Feelee to track the call logs, Bluetooth devices in proximity, cell tower IDs, app usage, and phone status (passive data). During treatment sessions, both adolescents and clinicians reviewed and discussed the active and passive data. Semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescents and clinicians (n=7) to gather experiences and feedback on the feasibility and usability of incorporating smartphone data into treatment.\nRESULTS: The study showed that adolescents (n=3) succeeded in using Feelee for the full 2 weeks, and data were available for discussion in at least 1 session per participant. Both adolescents and clinicians (n=7) stated that Feelee was valuable for viewing, discussing, and gaining insight into their emotions, which facilitated targeted actions based on the Feelee data. However, neither adolescents nor clinicians reported increased engagement in treatment as a result of using Feelee. Despite technical issues, overall feedback on the Feelee app, in addition to treatment, was positive (n=7). However, further improvements are needed to address the high battery consumption and the inaccuracies in the accelerometer.\nCONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study provides an in-depth understanding of the potential benefits of integrating active and passive smartphone data for adolescents in a forensic outpatient setting. Feelee appears to contribute to a better understanding of emotions and behaviors, suggesting its potential value in enhancing emotional awareness in treatment. Further research is needed to assess Feelee's clinical effectiveness and explore how it enhances emotional awareness. Recommendations from adolescents and clinicians emphasize the need for prepilot studies to address user issues, guiding technical improvements and future research in forensic outpatient settings.","author":[{"family":"Leijse","given":"Merel M.

  {"id":"lelutiu-weinbergerPilotTrialLGBTQAffirmative2025","abstract":"Transgender and gender expansive (TGE) individuals face minority stress and associated health risks, especially in high-stigma contexts. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ)-affirmative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the only evidence-based interventions developed to address minority stress to improve psychosocial health. Yet, trials of this treatment have mostly enrolled cisgender sexual minorities, TGE youth, and those living in North American contexts. This study tested the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT for TGE adults living in the high-stigma context of Romania. Twenty-five TGE individuals (Mage = 25.16, SDage = 6.39; 44% transgender women, 40% transgender men, 16% nonbinary) reporting depression and/or anxiety symptoms received 16 virtual sessions of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT from trained psychologists. Assessments of mental (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., hazardous drinking), and sexual (e.g., HIV-transmission risk behavior) health outcomes, and minority stress and universal risk mechanisms were administered at baseline and 5-month follow-up. Results showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms and certain minority stress (e.g., anticipated stigma, identity concealment) and universal risk (e.g., unassertiveness) mechanisms from baseline to follow-up. The intervention was highly feasible (e.g., timely recruitment, high session attendance), and exit interviews revealed high acceptability in terms of the treatment's relevance, goals, imparting minority stress knowledge and identity-related hope and acceptance, format, and therapeutic alliance. LGBTQ-affirmative CBT shows feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among TGE individuals living in Romania, with promise for other high-stigma contexts. Future randomized controlled trials and reductions in structural determinants remain priorities.","author":[{"family":"Lelutiu-Weinberger","given":"Corina"},{"family":"Filimon","given":"Mircea L."},{"family":"Chiaramonte","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Sarah I."},{"family":"Dogaru","given":"Bogdan"},{"family":"Pana","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Pruneanu","given":"Cristiana"},{"family":"Pachankis","given":"John E."}],"citation-key":"lelutiu-weinbergerPilotTrialLGBTQAffirmative2025","container-title":"Behavior Therapy","container-title-short":"Behav Ther","DOI":"10.1016/j.beth.2024.10.005","ISSN":"1878-1888","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"723-737","PMCID":"PMC12181672","PMID":"40541374","source":"PubMed","title":"A Pilot Trial of an LGBTQ-Affirmative Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Transgender and Gender Expansive Individuals' Mental, Behavioral, and Sexual Health","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

The Building Rapport, Improving Dialogue, and Growing Empathy intervention contains a values clarification exercise and question prompt list that parents can opt to share with the health care team. Parent and clinician participants completed surveys and semistructured interviews ≥72 hours postintervention. The primary outcome was intervention feasibility, defined as an enrollment rate ≥50% and a complete data collection rate ≥80%. Secondary outcomes included intervention acceptability and preparation for decision-making (Preparedness for Decision-Making Scale, score: 0-100, higher scores indicating higher preparedness). Statistical analyses were descriptive, and interviews were analyzed using a rapid-cycle qualitative approach.\nRESULTS: Thirty clinicians and 44 parents of 30 infants were enrolled (enrollment rate: 56%; complete data collection rate: 97%). The majority of parents and clinicians endorsed the tool as helpful, would recommend the tool to other parents, and would use the tool in the future. Preparedness for decision-making was high for both mothers (median score = 82, IQR: 70.0-90.0) and fathers (median score = 60, IQR: 38-74). Qualitative analysis of the intervention's impact identified 4 themes: (1) providing a scaffold; (2) validating and affirming experience; (3) preparing for a conversation; and (4) facilitating connection.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Building Rapport, Improving Dialogue, and Growing Empathy intervention was feasible and acceptable to parents and clinicians.

  {"id":"leungEffectsNonclinicianGuidance2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions are increasingly prevalent in the current context of rapidly evolving technology, and research indicates that they yield effectiveness outcomes comparable to in-person treatment. Integrating professionals (ie, psychologists and physicians) into digital mental health interventions has become common, and the inclusion of guidance within programs can increase adherence to interventions. However, employing professionals to enhance mental health programs may undermine the scalability of digital interventions. Therefore, delegating guidance tasks to paraprofessionals (peer supporters, technicians, lay counsellors, or other nonclinicians) can help reduce costs and increase accessibility.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness, adherence, and other process outcomes of nonclinician-guided digital mental health interventions.\nMETHODS: Four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were searched for randomized controlled trials published between 2010 and 2020 examining digital mental health interventions. Three journals that focus on digital intervention were hand searched; gray literature was searched using ProQuest and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL). Two researchers independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2. Data were collected on effectiveness, adherence, and other process outcomes, and meta-analyses were conducted for effectiveness and adherence outcomes. Nonclinician-guided interventions were compared with treatment as usual, clinician-guided interventions, and unguided interventions.\nRESULTS: Thirteen studies qualified for inclusion. Nonclinician-guided interventions yielded higher posttreatment effectiveness outcomes when compared to conditions involving control programs (eg, online psychoeducation and monitored attention control) or wait-list controls (k=7, Hedges g=-0.73; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.38). There were also significant differences between nonclinician-guided interventions and unguided interventions (k=6, Hedges g=-0.17; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11). In addition, nonclinician-guided interventions did not differ in effectiveness from clinician-guided interventions (k=3, Hedges g=0.08; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.17). These results suggest that guided digital mental health interventions are helpful to improve mental health outcomes regardless of the qualifications of the individual performing the intervention, and that the presence of a nonclinician guide improves effectiveness outcomes compared to having no guide. Nonclinician-guided interventions did not yield significantly different adherence outcomes when compared with unguided interventions (k=3, odds ratio 1.58; 95% CI 0.51 to 4.92), although a general trend of improved adherence was observed within nonclinician-guided interventions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrating paraprofessionals and nonclinicians appears to improve the outcomes of digital mental health interventions, and may also enhance adherence outcomes (though this trend was nonsignificant). Further research should focus on the specific types of tasks these paraprofessionals can successfully provide (ie, psychosocial support, therapeutic alliance, and technical augmentation) and their associated outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42020191226; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=191226.","author":[{"family":"Leung","given":"Calista"},{"family":"Pei","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Hudec","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Shams","given":"Farhud"},{"family":"Munthali","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Vigo","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"leungEffectsNonclinicianGuidance2022","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/36004","ISSN":"1438-8871","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"e36004","PMCID":"PMC9244656","PMID":"35511463","source":"PubMed","title":"The Effects of Nonclinician Guidance on Effectiveness and Process Outcomes in Digital Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","title-short":"The Effects of Nonclinician Guidance on Effectiveness and Process Outcomes in Digital Mental Health Interventions","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"lewisAbruptTransitionFacetoface2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Studies investigating patients' perspectives towards an abrupt transition from face-to-face to online treatment in eating disorders (EDs) are scarce. The current study aimed to (1) conduct a preliminary assessment of patients' perspectives regarding this transition, and (2) explore potential demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with these perspectives.\nMETHODS: Sixty-three patients with EDs whose treatment was moved to an online format, were surveyed during the COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020). A 6-item measure was developed to examine their perspectives toward this transition. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) were conducted to confirm the rational-theoretical structure of the measure (Eigenvalue = 3.745, explaining 62.4% of variance). The Cronbach's alpha value was excellent (α = 0.878). Validated questionnaires were used to measure ED symptoms, general psychopathology, therapeutic alliance, and pandemic anxiety, and their associations with our transition-focused scale and telemedicine satisfaction were examined.\nRESULTS: Mixed views were found regarding the transition, with the majority (68%) stating that they would not choose to continue online therapy given the option. Longer duration of treatment (r = 0.291, p = 0.022), stronger therapeutic alliance (r = 0.293, p = 0.028), and higher COVID-19 anxiety (r = 0.276, p = 0.029) were linked with more positive views towards the transition.\nCONCLUSIONS: Analyses suggest that patients' perspectives towards the transition can be measured using a Likert-type 6-item scale. Findings highlight the various responses to online treatment and indicate a need to identify patients who may face difficulties in the transition to this newly ubiquitous treatment mode. Clinicians should be cognizant of these potential difficulties and consider appropriate modes of treatment in the ongoing pandemic situation.","author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"Yael Doreen"},{"family":"Elran-Barak","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Grundman-Shem Tov","given":"Rinat"},{"family":"Zubery","given":"Eynat"}],"citation-key":"lewisAbruptTransitionFacetoface2021","container-title":"Journal of Eating Disorders","container-title-short":"J Eat Disord","DOI":"10.1186/s40337-021-00383-y","ISSN":"2050-2974","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"31","PMCID":"PMC7934980","PMID":"33673876","source":"PubMed","title":"The abrupt transition from face-to-face to online treatment for eating disorders: a pilot examination of patients' perspectives during the COVID-19 lockdown","title-short":"The abrupt transition from face-to-face to online treatment for eating disorders","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"liDevelopmentMeasureQuantifying2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the number of empirical studies identifying the helpful factors correlated with beneficial psychotherapy outcomes, there is no validated scale that measures helpful therapeutic attitudes and interventions applied by therapists within the actual therapy process in China. In the current study, we developed the Helpful Therapeutic Attitudes and Interventions Scale (HTAIS) as an accessible client-rated instrument to measure useful interventions applied by the therapist during psychotherapy sessions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the results of previous literature and our prior psychotherapy process studies, a 40-item measure was initially designed. Two studies with a total of 2,780 Chinese participants who received psychotherapy were carried out to evaluate the structure, reliability, and validity of the developed scale.\nRESULTS: Principal component analysis yielded a three-component HTAIS containing 26 items. The scale included dimensions labeled \"Empathy, respect and neutrality,\" \"Using techniques to solve practical issues,\" and \"In-depth exploration and expansion.\" Confirmatory factor analysis showed the construct validity of the derived three components model. And the developed scale had high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The scale scores of the HTAIS were positively correlated with those of the Working Alliance Scale and Session Rating Scale, as well as clients' perceived therapy satisfaction, thus supporting its concurrent validity.\nCONCLUSION: The HTAIS allows an immediate examination, as experienced by the client, of the extent to which certain useful therapeutics interventions have been conducted during therapy and could help to improve the clinician's subsequent therapy strategies. Future research is suggested to further validate the scale, especially to assess its psychometric properties in various populations with different clinical complaints.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaobao"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xudong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fazhan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Liang"}],"citation-key":"liDevelopmentMeasureQuantifying2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1023346","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1023346","PMCID":"PMC9743966","PMID":"36518363","source":"PubMed","title":"Development of a measure quantifying helpful psychotherapy interventions: The Helpful Therapeutic Attitudes and Interventions Scale","title-short":"Development of a measure quantifying helpful psychotherapy interventions","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"limSynchronySynchronyEstablishing2024","abstract":"Interpersonal synchrony is a crucial construct in understanding social interactions, which has been used in clinical studies to measure the quality of the therapeutic alliance. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the correlation between synchrony expressed on different levels: behavioural and neurophysiological. Furthermore, there are no studies that examine how the implementation of psychodramatic role-playing techniques, when individuals adopt the persona of a different character, may influence intrinsic biobehavioural synchrony between two parties. The present study, therefore, aims to uncover the relationship between behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony across different role-playing techniques and elucidate the impact of these synchronies on participants' levels of anxiety and empathy. By using functional near-infrared imaging and behavioural coding in a dyadic role-playing paradigm (n = 41 dyads), the study found correlations between behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony during naturalistic conversations, but not during role-play, implying a qualitative change in interpersonal synchrony when implementing role-playing techniques. Additionally, the study noted significant contributions of both behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony as well as peripheral factors such as dyadic sex make-up and role immersion in predicting dyadic anxiety and empathy changes. Findings call for future studies to consider role-playing scenarios as a qualitatively different form of social interaction.","author":[{"family":"Lim","given":"Mengyu"},{"family":"Carollo","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Bizzego","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Annabel S.

  {"id":"linCOMPASSComputationalMapping2025","abstract":"The therapeutic working alliance is a critical predictor of psychotherapy success. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze session transcripts and map them to distributed representations. These representations capture the semantic similarities between the dialogues and psychometric instruments, such as the Working Alliance Inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions spanning diverse psychiatric conditions -- including anxiety (N = 498), depression (N = 377), schizophrenia (N = 71), and suicidal tendencies (N = 12) -- collected between 1970 and 2012, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories, offering interpretable insights for clinical practice, and identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and how these topics evolve during each turn of the conversation. This integrated framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enables timely feedback for therapists on the quality of therapeutic relationships, and provides clear, actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Baihan"},{"family":"Bouneffouf","given":"Djallel"},{"family":"Landa","given":"Yulia"},{"family":"Jespersen","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Corcoran","given":"Cheryl"},{"family":"Cecchi","given":"Guillermo"}],"citation-key":"linCOMPASSComputationalMapping2025","container-title":"Translational Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Transl Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-025-03379-3","ISSN":"2158-3188","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"166","PMCID":"PMC12081631","PMID":"40374613","source":"PubMed","title":"COMPASS: Computational mapping of patient-therapist alliance strategies with language modeling","title-short":"COMPASS","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression.\nMETHODS: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected.\nRESULTS: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at baseline.

Follow-up analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01).

  {"id":"lundqvistSwedishEliteAthletes2024","abstract":"This study explores elite athletes' experiences of psychotherapy administered by Swedish licensed psychologists or psychotherapists with and without specialisation in elite sports, addressing the research question: What do elite athletes experience as important for psychotherapy effectiveness when seeking treatment from a licensed clinical psychologist or psychotherapist? Five elite athletes (self-assigned women=4, self-assigned men=1; age range: 20-34 years) from three sports (fencing: n=2, handball: n=2, triathlon: n=1) volunteered to participate in interviews. All athletes had worked with more than one licensed psychologists/psychotherapist, either through a regional healthcare or an elite sports specialised clinic while being national or international elite sports level athletes. Data were inductively analysed by the use of reflexive thematic analysis. Trust and professionalism to the psychologist/psychotherapist were generated as an overarching theme. Themes created during data analysis included the psychologist/psychotherapist's (a) understanding of elite sports and of both the person and the athlete, (b) psychotherapeutic behaviours or skills (ie, holistic problem assessment, communication, empathy, validation, confidentiality, therapeutic alliance, goal-oriented content and ability to tailor psychotherapy to the athlete) and (c) conditions for psychotherapy (time, accessibility and appropriate support). Participants expressed difficulties in differentiating between qualified and unqualified mental health support providers. Mental health services originating within the sport context were perceived to improve accessibility and the possibility of regular sessions. Mental health services provided outside the immediate sporting context, with the psychologist/psychotherapist not being overly involved in sports, was however perceived to enable a more objective and holistic assessment of both non-sport and sport-related concerns impacting on athlete mental health. We conclude that sports organisations must facilitate athletes' access to psychological treatment, and additionally ensure that practitioners working with psychotherapy have professional expertise and are appropriately qualified. Sports organisations should also systematically evaluate mental health services to ensure quality and that they are up to date with best practices.","author":[{"family":"Lundqvist","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Wig","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Schary","given":"David P."}],"citation-key":"lundqvistSwedishEliteAthletes2024","container-title":"BMJ open sport & exercise medicine","container-title-short":"BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med","DOI":"10.1136/bmjsem-2024-002044","ISSN":"2055-7647","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e002044","PMCID":"PMC11331869","PMID":"39161557","source":"PubMed","title":"Swedish elite athletes' experiences of psychotherapy for mental health concerns provided by licensed psychologists and psychotherapists: a qualitative study","title-short":"Swedish elite athletes' experiences of psychotherapy for mental health concerns provided by licensed psychologists and psychotherapists","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"lvAssociationUserInteraction2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The quality of user interaction with therapeutic tools has been positively associated with treatment response; however, no studies have investigated these relationships for voice-based digital tools.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationships between objective and subjective user interaction measures as well as treatment response on Lumen, a novel voice-based coach, delivering problem-solving treatment to patients with mild to moderate depression or anxiety or both.\nMETHODS: In a pilot trial, 42 adults with clinically significant depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) or anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7]) symptoms or both received Lumen, a voice-based coach delivering 8 problem-solving treatment sessions. Objective (number of conversational breakdowns, ie, instances where a participant's voice input could not be interpreted by Lumen) and subjective user interaction measures (task-related workload, user experience, and treatment alliance) were obtained for each session. Changes in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at each ensuing session after session 1 measured the treatment response.\nRESULTS: Participants were 38.9 (SD 12.9) years old, 28 (67%) were women, 8 (19%) were Black, 12 (29%) were Latino, 5 (12%) were Asian, and 28 (67%) had a high school or college education. Mean (SD) across sessions showed breakdowns (mean 6.5, SD 4.4 to mean 2.3, SD 1.8) decreasing over sessions, favorable task-related workload (mean 14.5, SD 5.6 to mean 17.6, SD 5.6) decreasing over sessions, neutral-to-positive user experience (mean 0.5, SD 1.4 to mean 1.1, SD 1.3), and high treatment alliance (mean 5.0, SD 1.4 to mean 5.3, SD 0.9). PHQ-9 (Ptrend=.001) and GAD-7 scores (Ptrend=.01) improved significantly over sessions. Treatment alliance correlated with improvements in PHQ-9 (Pearson r=-0.02 to -0.46) and GAD-7 (r=0.03 to -0.57) scores across sessions, whereas breakdowns and task-related workload did not. Mixed models showed that participants with higher individual mean treatment alliance had greater improvements in PHQ-9 (β=-1.13, 95% CI -2.16 to -0.10) and GAD-7 (β=-1.17, 95% CI -2.13 to -0.20) scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: The participants had fewer conversational breakdowns and largely favorable user interactions with Lumen across sessions. Conversational breakdowns were not associated with subjective user interaction measures or treatment responses, highlighting how participants adapted and effectively used Lumen. Individuals experiencing higher treatment alliance had greater improvements in depression and anxiety. Understanding treatment alliance can provide insights on improving treatment response for this new delivery modality, which provides accessibility, flexibility, comfort with disclosure, and cost-related advantages compared to conventional psychotherapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04524104; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04524104.","author":[{"family":"Lv","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Kannampallil","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Ronneberg","given":"Corina R."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Wittels","given":"Nancy E."},{"family":"Ajilore","given":"Olusola A."},{"family":"Smyth","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"lvAssociationUserInteraction2023","container-title":"JMIR human factors","container-title-short":"JMIR Hum Factors","DOI":"10.2196/49715","ISSN":"2292-9495","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"e49715","PMCID":"PMC10660207","PMID":"37930781","source":"PubMed","title":"Association Between User Interaction and Treatment Response of a Voice-Based Coach for Treating Depression and Anxiety: Secondary Analysis of a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Association Between User Interaction and Treatment Response of a Voice-Based Coach for Treating Depression and Anxiety","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Despite their demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, however, they often suffer from low sustained engagement in real-world contexts. Digital alliance (i.e., therapeutic alliance between user and app) may enhance engagement and outcomes, but its role in guided digital interventions (i.e., those with human support) is little understood.\nOBJECTIVE: Using data from two studies involving the mental health app mindLAMP, we examined digital alliance and its association with engagement and outcomes.\nMETHODS: In Study 1, mindLAMP was offered as a standalone app with several brief check-ins by a digital navigator (aka coach). In Study 2, mindLAMP was integrated into a brief teletherapy program supported by a clinician and a digital navigator. Digital alliance was assessed near study midpoint with a validated measure.\nRESULTS: Digital alliance was associated with engagement in both studies. In Study 1, digital alliance predicted subsequent app engagement, b = 0.18, p < .01, adjusting for prior engagement, which remained significant, b = 0.62, p < .001. Similarly, in Study 2, digital alliance predicted subsequent engagement, b = 0.21, p < .01, adjusting for prior engagement, b = 0.22, p < .05.

  {"id":"macrynikolaEmotionRegulationSelfEfficacy2024","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Digital mental health interventions have shown promise for alleviating various forms of psychopathology, including depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms of such interventions remain largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to investigate a potential mechanistic process through which one hybrid digital mental health intervention (i.e., the Digital Clinic) might operate. We hypothesized that emotion regulation (ER) self-efficacy at the treatment midpoint may mediate the relationship between alliance (i.e., therapeutic alliance and digital alliance) and outcome (i.e., co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety) at the treatment endpoint.\nMETHODS: Data used in this study came from the Digital Clinic, a brief transdiagnostic telehealth treatment program augmented by a dual-purpose digital phenotyping and intervention smartphone app. Recruited primarily from primary care, participants were 82 adults (73% White, 64% cisgender women, mean age 41) receiving outpatient treatment in the northeastern United States. All constructs were measured with validated scales, including The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) for therapeutic alliance, the Digital Working Alliance Inventory (DWAI) for digital alliance, the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Emotions Short Form scale for ER self-efficacy, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) for co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nRESULTS: Significant reductions in co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety and significant increases in ER self-efficacy were found from baseline to treatment endpoint. Therapeutic and digital alliance at the midpoint each predicted reductions in co-morbid symptoms of depression and anxiety at the endpoint through ER self-efficacy, controlling for baseline scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that ER self-efficacy may be a proximal predictor of clinical improvement that may be enhanced by therapeutic and digital alliance. Future controlled research is essential to improve knowledge of the mechanisms of digital mental health interventions and to enhance their effectiveness.","author":[{"family":"Macrynikola","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Torous","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"macrynikolaEmotionRegulationSelfEfficacy2024","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

  {"id":"magillDefiningTherapeuticRelationship2024","abstract":"OVERVIEW: This article contributes to knowledge and practice of core processes that are shared by evidence-based alcohol or other drug (AOD) therapies. It is the fourth in a series with this aim, and here we discuss perhaps the most universally acknowledged ingredient of effective therapy - the therapeutic relationship. We consider various related terms and definitions in the literature, but in the present review, we offer a definition that underscores the context of behavior change.\nMETHOD: This study conducted a literature review and qualitative content analysis to derive a set of principles and practices for facilitating and maintaining the therapeutic relationship. The sources for this review included government-issued practice guidelines, therapy manuals or books, demonstration videos, and peer-reviewed articles (61 sources). The content analysis was performed in NVIVO, and reliability analysis showed moderate agreement between raters (kappa = 0.60).\nRESULTS: Six principles and 16 practices were identified. The distribution of principles and practices could be broken into three categories: 1) the facilitation of client behavior change mechanisms (i.e., self-determination, motivation, self-efficacy), 2) partnership considerations (e.g., goal and task alignment), and 3) therapist interpersonal skills (e.g., empathy).\nCONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic relationship is foundational to the behavior change process. We frame it as a combination of broader interpersonal considerations and attention to key mechanisms of client behavior change. The present work provides a novel resource for trainees, clinicians, and clinical supervisors interested in fostering therapy relationships with clients in AOD or other behavior change settings.","author":[{"family":"Magill","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Martino","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Wampold","given":"Bruce E."}],"citation-key":"magillDefiningTherapeuticRelationship2024","container-title":"Journal of Substance Use and Addiction Treatment","container-title-short":"J Subst Use Addict Treat","DOI":"10.1016/j.josat.2024.209398","ISSN":"2949-8759","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"209398","PMCID":"PMC11180559","PMID":"38754554","source":"PubMed","title":"Defining the therapeutic relationship in the context of alcohol use, other drug use, and behavior change: Principles and practices","title-short":"Defining the therapeutic relationship in the context of alcohol use, other drug use, and behavior change","type":"article-journal","volume":"163"},
  {"id":"malloneeExplainingEngagementOutpatient2022","abstract":"Objective: Adults with serious mental health conditions (SMHC) experience higher rates of disengagement from treatment. Factors associated with engagement in treatment in general for this population include therapeutic alliance, provider empathy, and perceived coercion. This cross-sectional exploratory study addressed the question: To what extent do client perceptions of therapeutic alliance, therapist empathy, and perceived coercion explain the degree of engagement in outpatient therapy for adults with SMHC? Method: An anonymous online survey measuring study variables was completed by 131 participants. The relationship between variables was tested using multivariate regression analysis with hierarchical blocks. Results: After separating therapeutic alliance and therapist empathy in the analysis due to multicollinearity and accounting for the influence of control variables, therapeutic alliance (B = .43, p < .01) and therapist empathy (B = .25, p < .01), but not perceived coercion, were associated with the degree of client engagement. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: For adults with SMHC enrolled in outpatient therapy, therapeutic alliance explained the greatest variation in the degree of engagement. Participants appeared to use outpatient therapy as a main strategy for pursuing recovery, and engagement in therapy may be increased if providers utilize strategies to strengthen expressions of empathy and bolster alliance. Additional research is needed to enhance understanding of engagement in therapy for this population and to develop more sensitive measures for evaluating these constructs.

  {"id":"malouin-lachanceDoesDigitalTherapeutic2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders significantly impact global populations, prompting the rise of digital mental health interventions, such as artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots, to address gaps in access to care. This review explores the potential for a \"digital therapeutic alliance (DTA),\" emphasizing empathy, engagement, and alignment with traditional therapeutic principles to enhance user outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to identify key concepts underlying the DTA in AI-driven psychotherapeutic interventions for mental health. The secondary objective was to propose an initial definition of the DTA based on these identified concepts.\nMETHODS: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for scoping reviews and Tavares de Souza's integrative review methodology were followed, encompassing systematic literature searches in Medline, Web of Science, PsycNet, and Google Scholar. Data from eligible studies were extracted and analyzed using Horvath et al's conceptual framework on a therapeutic alliance, focusing on goal alignment, task agreement, and the therapeutic bond, with quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 28 studies were identified from an initial pool of 1294 articles after excluding duplicates and ineligible studies. These studies informed the development of a conceptual framework for a DTA, encompassing key elements such as goal alignment, task agreement, therapeutic bond, user engagement, and the facilitators and barriers affecting therapeutic outcomes. The interventions primarily focused on AI-powered chatbots, digital psychotherapy, and other digital tools.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this integrative review provide a foundational framework for the concept of a DTA and report its potential to replicate key therapeutic mechanisms such as empathy, trust, and collaboration in AI-driven psychotherapeutic tools. While the DTA shows promise in enhancing accessibility and engagement in mental health care, further research and innovation are needed to address challenges such as personalization, ethical concerns, and long-term impact.","author":[{"family":"Malouin-Lachance","given":"Amylie"},{"family":"Capolupo","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Laplante","given":"Chloé"},{"family":"Hudon","given":"Alexandre"}],"citation-key":"malouin-lachanceDoesDigitalTherapeutic2025","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/69294","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"e69294","PMCID":"PMC11830484","PMID":"39924298","source":"PubMed","title":"Does the Digital Therapeutic Alliance Exist?

  {"id":"mayerViewsGermanMental2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are getting increasingly important for mental health care. In the case of eating disorders (EDs), DMHIs are still in early stages. Few studies so far investigated the views of mental health professionals for EDs on the integration of DMHIs in routine care.\nOBJECTIVE: To gain insights into the experiences, perspectives, and expectations of mental health professionals for EDs regarding DMHIs and to identify requirements for the future integration of DMHIs into routine care.\nMETHODS: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with 24 German mental health professionals treating patients with EDs were conducted. A content analysis following a deductive-inductive approach asked for experiences, advantages and chances, disadvantages and boundaries, desired functions and properties, target groups, and general conditions and requirements for DMHIs for patients with EDs.\nRESULTS: Only few professionals reported experiences with DMHIs besides video-based psychotherapy during the pandemic. From the therapists' point of view, DMHIs have the potential to deliver low-threshold access for patients with EDs. Useful functionalities were seen in digital meal records, skills training, and psychoeducation. However, a stable therapeutic alliance was reported as an important prerequisite for the successful integration into care. Therapists expressed concerns in case of severe anorexia nervosa or suicidality. The participants felt to be informed inadequately on recent developments and on the evidence base of DMHIs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mental health professionals for EDs show positive attitudes towards DMHIs, however many barriers to the integration in routine care were observed. The highest potential was seen for the use of DMHIs in addition to outpatient care and in aftercare. Specific requirements for DMHIs are related to different areas of the healthcare spectrum and for the different symptom profiles in anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Targeted DMHIs are needed and appropriate especially for concepts of blended care.","author":[{"family":"Mayer","given":"Gwendolyn"},{"family":"Lemmer","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Michelsen","given":"Ina"},{"family":"Schrader","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Friederich","given":"Hans-Christoph"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Stephanie"}],"citation-key":"mayerViewsGermanMental2024","container-title":"Journal of Eating Disorders","container-title-short":"J Eat Disord","DOI":"10.1186/s40337-024-00978-1","ISSN":"2050-2974","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"language":"eng","page":"32","PMCID":"PMC10885453","PMID":"38395950","source":"PubMed","title":"Views of German mental health professionals on the use of digital mental health interventions for eating disorders: a qualitative interview study","title-short":"Views of German mental health professionals on the use of digital mental health interventions for eating disorders","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

Transition-age youth (TAY) who have experienced or are experiencing complex trauma, system involvement and homelessness are at increased risk for serious mental health needs and related challenges. However, these vulnerable and historically marginalized TAY typically have low rates of mental health service engagement. This study examines how and why TAY experiencing system involvement, homelessness, and serious mental health and substance use symptoms engage in mental health services, and what facilitates and/or hinders their engagement in services. Methods. Twenty-one TAY completed a virtual interview about their previous and current mental health service experiences, and why they did or did not engage with mental health services. A modified grounded theory qualitative analysis approach was used to understand how participants' personal sense of meaning interacted with programmatic factors to construct participant experiences with mental health services. Results. Most participants (81%, n = 17) received mental health services, namely psychiatry (76%, n = 16) and counseling/therapy (48%, n = 10), and peer support (10%, n = 2). Participants described their mental health service experiences along three interpersonal and relational continuums between themselves and their providers: feeling (mis)understood, being treated with (dis)respect, and experiencing (dis)trust. Discussion. Study findings reveal that for these particularly vulnerable and marginalized TAY, relational and interpersonal factors significantly influenced their engagement in mental health services. Study findings call for providers to re-imagine their working alliance with highly vulnerable TAY through culturally-attuned practices that promote understanding, respect, and trust. Findings also call for TAY-serving programs and policies to re-imagine peer support as a mental health service option for this highly vulnerable population.","author":[{"family":"McCormick","given":"Katie A."},{"family":"Chatham","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Klodnick","given":"Vanessa V."},{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Deborah A."}],"citation-key":"mccormickMentalHealthService2022","container-title":"Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal: C & A","container-title-short":"Child Adolesc Social Work J","DOI":"10.1007/s10560-022-00890-0","ISSN":"0738-0151","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-12","PMCID":"PMC9638293","PMID":"36373126","source":"PubMed","title":"Mental Health Service Experiences Among Transition-Age Youth: Interpersonal Continuums that Influence Engagement in Care","title-short":"Mental Health Service Experiences Among Transition-Age Youth","type":"article-journal"},

We appeal to active inference to explain the empirically integrative neurophysiological and behavioural mechanisms that underwrite synchronous relationships through touch. Specifically, we offer a formal framework for understanding - and explaining - the role of therapeutic touch and hands-on care in developing a therapeutic alliance and synchrony between health care providers and their patients in musculoskeletal care. We first review the crucial importance of therapeutic touch and its clinical role in facilitating the formation of a solid therapeutic alliance and in regulating allostasis. We then consider how touch is used clinically - to promote cooperative communication, demonstrate empathy, overcome uncertainty, and infer the mental states of others - through the lens of active inference. We conclude that touch plays a crucial role in achieving successful clinical outcomes and adapting previous priors to create intertwined beliefs.

Through the lens of active inference, we present an integrative model, combining therapeutic touch and communication, to achieve biobehavioural synchrony. This model speaks to how the brain develops a generative model required for recovery, developing successful therapeutic alliances, and regulating allostasis within paediatric manual therapy. We apply active inference to explain the neurophysiological and behavioural mechanisms that underwrite the development and maintenance of synchronous relationships through touch. This paper foregrounds the crucial role of therapeutic touch in developing a solid therapeutic alliance, the clinical effectiveness of paediatric care, and triadic synchrony between health care practitioner, caregiver, and infant in a variety of clinical situations. We start by providing a brief overview of the significance and clinical role of touch in the development of social interactions in infants; facilitating a positive therapeutic alliance and restoring homeostasis through touch to allow a more efficient process of allostatic regulation. Moreover, we explain the role of CT tactile afferents in achieving positive clinical outcomes and updating prior beliefs. We then discuss how touch is implemented in treatment sessions to promote cooperative interactions in the clinic and facilitate theory of mind. This underwrites biobehavioural synchrony, epistemic trust, empathy, and the resolution of uncertainty.

  {"id":"mehtaMotorResonanceAction2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Virtual clinical interactions have increased tremendously since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While they certainly have their advantages, there also exist potential limitations, for example, in establishing a therapeutic alliance, discussing complex clinical scenarios, etc. This may be due to possible disruptions in the accurate activation of the human mirror neuron system (MNS), a posited physiological template for effective social communication.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare motor resonance, a putative marker of MNS activity, estimated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicited while viewing virtual (video-based) and actual or real (enacted by a person) actions in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that motor resonance will be greater during real compared to virtual action observation.\nMETHODS: We compared motor resonance or motor-evoked potential (MEP) facilitation during the observation of virtual (presented via videos) and real (enacted in person) actions, relative to static image observation in healthy individuals using TMS. The MEP recordings were obtained by 2 single-pulse (neuronal membrane excitability-driven) TMS paradigms of different intensities and 2 paired-pulse (cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid-interneuron-driven) TMS paradigms.\nRESULTS: This study comprised 64 participants. Using the repeated measures ANOVA, we observed a significant time effect for MEP facilitation from static to virtual and real observation states when recorded using 3 of the 4 TMS paradigms. Post hoc pairwise comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction revealed significant MEP facilitation in both virtual and real observation states relative to static image observation; however, we also observed a significant time effect between the 2 action observation states (real > virtual) with 2 of the 4 TMS paradigms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that visual cues expressed via both virtual (video) or real (in person) modes elicit physiological responses within the putative MNS, but this effect is more pronounced for actions presented in person. This has relevance to the appropriate implementation of digital health solutions, especially those pertaining to mental health.","author":[{"family":"Mehta","given":"Urvakhsh Meherwan"},{"family":"Basavaraju","given":"Rakshathi"},{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Kesavan","given":"Muralidharan"},{"family":"Thirthalli","given":"Jagadisha"}],"citation-key":"mehtaMotorResonanceAction2022","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/40652","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"e40652","PMCID":"PMC9636526","PMID":"36269658","source":"PubMed","title":"Motor Resonance During Action Observation and Its Relevance to Virtual Clinical Consultations: Observational Study Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","title-short":"Motor Resonance During Action Observation and Its Relevance to Virtual Clinical Consultations","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

By the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic erupted, forcing mental health services to transition to online meetings to maintain the standard of care. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the attitudes of adolescent patients toward this involuntary new mode of care.\nMETHODS: Forty-four adolescents (mean age 14.62 ± 2.12 years, 54.5% females) and 40 of their primary caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires that included the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire, session evaluation questionnaire, working alliance inventory, and pediatric symptom checklist.\nRESULTS: Both adolescents and their caregivers reported a reasonable experience with the online medium and a feeling that the meetings were overall powerful, helpful, and comfortable as demonstrated by medium to high scores on the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire and session evaluation questionnaire questionnaires. A therapeutic alliance was generally maintained according to working alliance inventory scores. However, working alliance inventory scores were negatively correlated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms and parental stress.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings point to the possibility that anxious/depressed adolescents will have greater difficulties re-establishing therapeutic alliance when transitioned from in-person to online meetings. This may be due to the introduction of an \"invisible\" third party to the therapeutic setting-the computer. Psychologists and psychiatrists should be aware of these difficulties and respond adequately to maintain the standard of care.","author":[{"family":"Mekori-Domachevsky","given":"Ehud"},{"family":"Matalon","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Yael"},{"family":"Shiffman","given":"Noga"},{"family":"Lurie","given":"Ido"},{"family":"Gothelf","given":"Doron"},{"family":"Dekel","given":"Idit"}],"citation-key":"mekori-domachevskyInternalizingSymptomsImpede2023","container-title":"Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare","container-title-short":"J Telemed Telecare","DOI":"10.1177/1357633X211021293","ISSN":"1758-1109","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"725-730","PMID":"34328367","source":"PubMed","title":"Internalizing symptoms impede adolescents' ability to transition from in-person to online mental health services during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"mercadalrotgerTherapeuticAllianceOnline2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of online mental health treatments have grown exponentially. Additionally, it seems inevitable that this technical resource is here to stay at health centers. However, there is still very little scholarly literature published on this topic, and therefore, the impact of the changes that have had to be dealt with in this regard has not been studied.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the differences in the establishment of the therapeutic alliance (TA) based on the intervention modality (online or face-to-face), the type of attachment, and diagnosis.\nMETHODS: A total of 291 subjects participated in the study, 149 (51.2%) of whom were men and 142 were (48.8%) women between the ages of 18 and 30 years. The instruments used were sociodemographic data, SOFTA-o (System for Observing Family Therapeutic Alliances-observational), and Relationship Questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The results show that the treatments conducted face-to-face obtain significantly better scores in the creation of the TA than those conducted online (t=-42.045, df=289, P<.001). The same holds true with attachment, in that users with secure attachment show a better TA than those with insecure attachment (t=6.068, P<.001,), although there were no significant differences with the diagnosis (F=4.566, P=.44), age (r=0.02, P=.70), and sex (t=0.217, P=.33).\nCONCLUSIONS: We believe that professionals are not yet prepared to conduct remote treatment with a degree of efficacy similar to that of face-to-face. It is essential for professionals to receive training in this new technical resource and to understand and incorporate the variants it entails into their daily practice.","author":[{"family":"Mercadal Rotger","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Cabré","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"mercadalrotgerTherapeuticAllianceOnline2022","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/36775","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"e36775","PMCID":"PMC9112077","PMID":"35499910","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapeutic Alliance in Online and Face-to-face Psychological Treatment: Comparative Study","title-short":"Therapeutic Alliance in Online and Face-to-face Psychological Treatment","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

Besides an overview into the efficacy of VR, a summary will be given on assumed working mechanisms in virtual reality exposure therapy and how this aligns with current theoretical models. Further, it will be discussed how VR is accepted by patients and research into the reluctance of therapist to use this technology during treatment with focus on the therapeutic alliance and how it may be influenced by the use of VR. Finally, we discuss clinical and future issues as, for example, dissemination into clinical practice and what VR has to offer therapists in future. This not only in adult population but as well in younger patients, as young adolescents VR has a great potential as it connects easily with its playful elements to this population and might be a low threshold step to offer treatment or preventive interventions.","author":[{"family":"Meyerbröker","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Morina","given":"Nexhmedin"}],"citation-key":"meyerbrokerUseVirtualReality2021","container-title":"Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1002/cpp.2623","ISSN":"1099-0879","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"466-476","PMCID":"PMC8362145","PMID":"34097318","source":"PubMed","title":"The use of virtual reality in assessment and treatment of anxiety and related disorders","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"montesanoDoesVirtualReality2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The improvement of psychological treatments for depression in young adults is a pressing issue highlighted in the literature. Its relevance is determined not only because young adults are underrepresented in research, but also to prevent chronic severe mental health disorders later in life. Engagement is considered a key factor for a good therapeutic outcome, especially among young patients. In this sense, virtual reality could be particularly suited to engage young adults in the therapy process. This project aims to improve the psychological treatment of mild-to-moderate depression in young adults by testing out the efficacy of virtual reality-enhanced personal construct therapy (PCT-VR), as compared to personal construct therapy alone (PCT) and to the reference standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In contrast to CBT, PCT neither educates patients about depression nor gives them directions on the changes to be made in their dysfunctional behaviors or cognitions. Rather, PCT explores the coherence (or conflicts) of thoughts and behaviors with respect to the person's sense of identity and focuses on meaning-making processes.\nMETHODS: The efficacy of this innovative intervention (PCT-VR) will be compared to PCT and to CBT in a randomized clinical trial. The study includes an appraisal of therapists' adherence and independent assessments to preserve internal validity. The Beck Depression Inventory-II is the primary outcome measure for calculating both statistical and clinical significance, but other outcomes will also be assessed (e.g., functioning, well-being, anxiety, stress) at pre- and post-therapy and at 6-month follow-up. The trial will be conducted in a naturalistic context, mostly at the usual health care center of each patient. A sample of 225 participants is targeted to reach enough statistical power to accomplish the goals of the study.\nDISCUSSION: We expect that providing evidence for PCT-VR will widen the repertoire of evidence-based technology-based psychotherapeutic interventions for young adults and contribute to the prevention of deteriorating courses of the disorder.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04321525 .

  {"id":"moreno-poyatoAssociationEmpathyNursepatient2021","abstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Empathy is one of the main attributes for establishing the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship. Davis (1983) identified four components on an empathic response: perspective taking, fantasy, empathetic concern and personal distress. It is essential to deepen our knowledge on the influence of the dimensions of empathy for the construction and development of the therapeutic alliance during the different phases of the therapeutic relationship. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: A significant association exists between the dimensions of empathy and the construction and development of the therapeutic alliance during the different phases of the therapeutic relationship between nurses and patients in mental health units. This study shows that the nurses' perspective on the patient's situation improves the bond, and therefore, this skill is especially useful in the first phase or orientation phase of the therapeutic relationship. However, for the second phase or working phase of the therapeutic relationship, a greater empathic concern among nurses, together with less personal distress, improves collaborative goal setting with patients. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: It is important for mental health nurses to be aware of the importance of personal self-awareness and the emotional management of empathy for the construction and development of therapeutic relationships of quality with patients. Knowledge of the relationship between each of the dimensions of empathy in the different stages of the therapeutic relationship is useful for the design of educational programmes, by including training on empathic strategies. ABSTRACT: Introduction Empathy and its dimensions (perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress and fantasy) are essential for establishing the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship. It is important to know how this influences the construction and development of the therapeutic alliance during the different phases of the therapeutic relationship. Aim To examine whether the dimensions of empathy influence the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship within mental health units. Method A cross-sectional design was used to collect data to measure the therapeutic alliance and the different dimensions of empathy via an online form completed by nurses working at 18 mental health units. Linear regressions were used in the analysis. Results A total of 198 participants completed the questionnaires. Nurses established a greater therapeutic alliance with patients when they were able to adopt their patient's perspective and experience concern. Discussion Nurses' perspective taking is an influential factor impacting the nurse-patient bond in the orientation phase, whereas experiencing greater concern and decreased emotional distress were associated with improved therapeutic alliance in the working phase. Implications for practice These findings may help gain awareness among nurses of the importance of empathy in the nurse-patient relationships, as well as inform educational programmes, by including training in empathic strategies and emotional management.","author":[{"family":"Moreno-Poyato","given":"Antonio R."},{"family":"Rodríguez-Nogueira","given":"Óscar"},{"literal":"MiRTCIME.CAT working group"}],"citation-key":"moreno-poyatoAssociationEmpathyNursepatient2021","container-title":"Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing","container-title-short":"J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs","DOI":"10.1111/jpm.12675","ISSN":"1365-2850","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"335-343","PMID":"32657511","source":"PubMed","title":"The association between empathy and the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship in mental health units: a cross-sectional study","title-short":"The association between empathy and the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship in mental health units","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Data were collected before and after the intervention, which consisted of the design, implementation and evaluation of strategies to improve the therapeutic relationship through participatory-action research involving nurses. The Working Alliance Inventory-Short, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire and Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index were used. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used together with the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Two multiple linear regressions models were constructed.\nRESULTS: Overall, the intervention improved the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship. In addition, the results revealed that, above all, the improvement in evidence-based practice along with a decrease in nurses' personal distress were the factors associated with the improvement of the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship.\nCONCLUSION: In mental health units, the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship can be improved through participatory interventions that include the implementation of evidence-based practices.\nIMPACT: This research examined the effects of an intervention aimed at improving the therapeutic relationship among nurses working at mental health units using participatory action research. The results show that the therapeutic relationship can be improved through participatory methods where evidence-based practice is implemented and enhanced among nurses, since a better therapeutic relationship along with reduced staff discomfort are determining factors that influence the quality of the therapeutic relationship.

  {"id":"morrowArtificialIntelligenceTechnologies2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, together with the availability of big data in society, creates uncertainties about how these developments will affect healthcare systems worldwide. Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare?\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice.\nRESULTS: Searches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, n = 1 to 2021, n = 47 and from Jan-Aug 2022 n = 35 articles). Overarching themes related to the review questions were: (1) Developments and debates (7 themes) Concerns about AI ethics, healthcare jobs, and loss of empathy; Human-centered design of AI technologies for healthcare; Optimistic speculation AI technologies will address care gaps; Interrogation of what it means to be human and to care; Recognition of future potential for patient monitoring, virtual proximity, and access to healthcare; Calls for curricula development and healthcare professional education; Implementation of AI applications to enhance health and wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. (2) How AI technologies enhance compassion (10 themes) Empathetic awareness; Empathetic response and relational behavior; Communication skills; Health coaching; Therapeutic interventions; Moral development learning; Clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; Healthcare quality assessment; Therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; Providing health information and advice. (3) Gaps in knowledge (4 themes) Educational effectiveness of AI-assisted learning; Patient diversity and AI technologies; Implementation of AI technologies in education and practice settings; Safety and clinical effectiveness of AI technologies. (4) Key areas for development (3 themes) Enriching education, learning and clinical practice; Extending healing spaces; Enhancing healing relationships.\nCONCLUSION: There is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a human-AI system of intelligent caring comprising six elements: (1) Awareness of suffering (e.g., pain, distress, risk, disadvantage); (2) Understanding the suffering (significance, context, rights, responsibilities etc.); (3) Connecting with the suffering (e.g., verbal, physical, signs and symbols); (4) Making a judgment about the suffering (the need to act); (5) Responding with an intention to alleviate the suffering; (6) Attention to the effect and outcomes of the response. These elements can operate at an individual (human or machine) and collective systems level (healthcare organizations or systems) as a cyclical system to alleviate different types of suffering. New and novel approaches to human-AI intelligent caring could enrich education, learning, and clinical practice; extend healing spaces; and enhance healing relationships.\nIMPLICATIONS: In a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring.","author":[{"family":"Morrow","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Zidaru","given":"Teodor"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Cindy"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Kunal D."},{"family":"Ream","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Stockley","given":"Rich"}],"citation-key":"morrowArtificialIntelligenceTechnologies2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.971044","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"971044","PMCID":"PMC9887144","PMID":"36733854","source":"PubMed","title":"Artificial intelligence technologies and compassion in healthcare: A systematic scoping review","title-short":"Artificial intelligence technologies and compassion in healthcare","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"mussenerDigitalEncountersHuman2021","abstract":"Digitalization and high mobile phone ownership globally have radically changed communication in all areas of society, including health care. Previous research has shown the effectiveness of behavior change interventions delivered by mobile phones and has highlighted advantages, such as that they require fewer resources than traditional face-to-face interventions and can be delivered at any time. One of the foremost questions pertaining to unsupported digital interventions is whether they can ever be comparable to in-person interventions. Little is known about the therapeutic alliance and the specific qualities of encounters in digital interactions for behavior change. Human interactions in digital interventions and their relationship with outcomes require further investigation. This paper aims to encourage critical reflection and further consideration of mHealth behavior change interventions in a digital age, when even the professional is excluded from the intervention.

Patient experience of telemedicine has generally been positive, but widespread use of videoconferencing outside of healthcare has brought growing recognition of associated mental fatigue. Experience in telepsychiatry shows attending to non-verbal communication and maintaining empathic rapport requires increased mental effort, making provider experience more sensitive to cumulative fatigue effects. Since empathy and therapeutic alliance are foundational to all physician-patient relationships, these telepsychiatry findings have implications for telehealth generally.

  {"id":"nesbittTestingDashboardIntervention2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mood and anxiety disorders are prevalent mental health diagnoses. Numerous studies have shown that measurement-based care, which is used to monitor patient symptoms, functioning, and treatment progress and help guide clinical decisions and collaboration on treatment goals, can improve outcomes in patients with these disorders. Including digital information regarding patients' electronic communications and social media activity is an innovative approach to augmenting measurement-based care. Recent data indicate interest and willingness from both mental health clinicians and patients to share this type of digital information in treatment sessions. However, the clinical benefit of systematically doing this has been minimally evaluated.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an electronic dashboard for tracking patients' digital social activity and a protocol for a pragmatic randomized trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of using the dashboard in real-world clinical care of patients with depression or anxiety disorders.\nMETHODS: We developed a personalized electronic dashboard that tracks patients' electronic communications and social media activity, visualizes data on these interactions through key graphics and figures, and provides a tool that can be readily integrated into routine clinical care for use by clinicians and patients during treatment sessions. We then designed a randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the electronic dashboard in real-world care compared to treatment as usual. The trial included patients aged ≥12 years with a mood or anxiety disorder who were receiving treatment in outpatient psychiatry clinics in the Johns Hopkins Health System and the Kennedy Krieger Institute. The primary outcome includes changes in patient-rated depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes include changes in patient-rated anxiety symptoms and overall functioning. Exploratory analyses examine the impact of the intervention on measures of therapeutic alliance and the detection of clinically actionable targets.\nRESULTS: We successfully developed an electronic dashboard for tracking patients' electronic communications and social media activity, and we implemented a protocol for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of using the dashboard in routine care for mood or anxiety disorders. The protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. In this study, we report the technological, ethical, and pragmatic considerations in developing the dashboard and testing it in a real-world setting.\nCONCLUSIONS: The integration of an electronic dashboard to monitor digital social activity in mental health care treatment is novel. This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of the dashboard and the challenges in implementing this protocol. The lessons learned from developing and implementing the study will inform ongoing discussions about the value of gathering collateral information on patients' digital social activity and how to do so in a way that is acceptable and clinically effective.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03925038; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03925038.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/63279.","author":[{"family":"Nesbitt","given":"Brittany"},{"family":"Virgadamo","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Aguirre","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"DeCamp","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Dredze","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Harrigian","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Lhaksampa","given":"Tenzin"},{"family":"Meuchel","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Aja M."},{"family":"Walker","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Zirikly","given":"Ayah"},{"family":"Chisolm","given":"Margaret S."},{"family":"Zandi","given":"Peter P."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Leslie"}],"citation-key":"nesbittTestingDashboardIntervention2025","container-title":"JMIR research protocols","container-title-short":"JMIR Res Protoc","DOI":"10.2196/63279","ISSN":"1929-0748","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"e63279","PMCID":"PMC11923457","PMID":"40053788","source":"PubMed","title":"Testing a Dashboard Intervention for Tracking Digital Social Media Activity in Clinical Care of Individuals With Mood and Anxiety Disorders: Protocol and Design Considerations for a Pragmatic Randomized Trial","title-short":"Testing a Dashboard Intervention for Tracking Digital Social Media Activity in Clinical Care of Individuals With Mood and Anxiety Disorders","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"nissenEffectsHealthCare2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The working alliance refers to an important relationship quality between health professionals and clients that robustly links to treatment success. Recent research shows that clients can develop an affective bond with chatbots. However, few research studies have investigated whether this perceived relationship is affected by the social roles of differing closeness a chatbot can impersonate and by allowing users to choose the social role of a chatbot.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed at understanding how the social role of a chatbot can be expressed using a set of interpersonal closeness cues and examining how these social roles affect clients' experiences and the development of an affective bond with the chatbot, depending on clients' characteristics (ie, age and gender) and whether they can freely choose a chatbot's social role.\nMETHODS: Informed by the social role theory and the social response theory, we developed a design codebook for chatbots with different social roles along an interpersonal closeness continuum. Based on this codebook, we manipulated a fictitious health care chatbot to impersonate one of four distinct social roles common in health care settings-institution, expert, peer, and dialogical self-and examined effects on perceived affective bond and usage intentions in a web-based lab study. The study included a total of 251 participants, whose mean age was 41.15 (SD 13.87) years; 57.0% (143/251) of the participants were female. Participants were either randomly assigned to one of the chatbot conditions (no choice: n=202, 80.5%) or could freely choose to interact with one of these chatbot personas (free choice: n=49, 19.5%). Separate multivariate analyses of variance were performed to analyze differences (1) between the chatbot personas within the no-choice group and (2) between the no-choice and the free-choice groups.\nRESULTS: While the main effect of the chatbot persona on affective bond and usage intentions was insignificant (P=.87), we found differences based on participants' demographic profiles: main effects for gender (P=.04, ηp2=0.115) and age (P<.001, ηp2=0.192) and a significant interaction effect of persona and age (P=.01, ηp2=0.102). Participants younger than 40 years reported higher scores for affective bond and usage intentions for the interpersonally more distant expert and institution chatbots; participants 40 years or older reported higher outcomes for the closer peer and dialogical-self chatbots. The option to freely choose a persona significantly benefited perceptions of the peer chatbot further (eg, free-choice group affective bond: mean 5.28, SD 0.89; no-choice group affective bond: mean 4.54, SD 1.10; P=.003, ηp2=0.117).\nCONCLUSIONS: Manipulating a chatbot's social role is a possible avenue for health care chatbot designers to tailor clients' chatbot experiences using user-specific demographic factors and to improve clients' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward the chatbot. Our results also emphasize the benefits of letting clients freely choose between chatbots.","author":[{"family":"Nißen","given":"Marcia"},{"family":"Rüegger","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Stieger","given":"Mirjam"},{"family":"Flückiger","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Allemand","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"V Wangenheim","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Kowatsch","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"nissenEffectsHealthCare2022","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/32630","ISSN":"1438-8871","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e32630","PMCID":"PMC9096656","PMID":"35475761","source":"PubMed","title":"The Effects of Health Care Chatbot Personas With Different Social Roles on the Client-Chatbot Bond and Usage Intentions: Development of a Design Codebook and Web-Based Study","title-short":"The Effects of Health Care Chatbot Personas With Different Social Roles on the Client-Chatbot Bond and Usage Intentions","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"notermansPsychotherapyLockdownUse2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, some psychotherapists had to propose remote consultations, i.e., teleconsultation. While some evidence suggests positive outcomes from teleconsultation, professionals still hold negative beliefs towards it. Additionally, no rigorous and integrative practice framework for teleconsultation has yet been developed. This article aims to explore the use and experience of teleconsultation by 1) investigating differences between psychotherapists proposing and not proposing it; 2) evaluating the impact of negative attitudes towards teleconsultation on various variables; 3) determining the perceived detrimental effect of teleconsultation, as opposed to in-person, on the therapeutic relationship and personal experience; and 4) providing insights for the development of a teleconsultation practice framework.\nMETHOD: An online survey was distributed via different professional organisations across several countries to 246 (195 women) French-speaking psychotherapists.\nRESULTS: Psychotherapists who did not propose teleconsultation believed it to be more technically challenging than psychotherapists who proposed it, but felt less constrained to propose it, and had less colleagues offering it. Attitudes towards teleconsultation showed no significant associations with therapeutic relationship, personal experience, and percentage of teleconsultation. As compared to in-person, empathy, congruence, and therapeutic alliance were perceived to significantly deteriorate online, whereas work organisation was perceived to be significantly better. While most psychotherapists proposed remote consultations, they did not provide adaptations to such setting (e.g., ascertaining a neutral video background); nor used videoconferencing platforms meeting privacy and confidentiality criteria.\nCONCLUSION: Training and evidenced-based information should be urgently provided to practitioners to develop rigorous guidelines and an ethically and legally safe practice framework.","author":[{"family":"Notermans","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Philippot","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"notermansPsychotherapyLockdownUse2022","container-title":"Clinical Psychology in Europe","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Eur","DOI":"10.32872/cpe.6821","ISSN":"2625-3410","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"e6821","PMCID":"PMC9667335","PMID":"36398003","source":"PubMed","title":"Psychotherapy Under Lockdown: The Use and Experience of Teleconsultation by Psychotherapists During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","title-short":"Psychotherapy Under Lockdown","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"ochoa-arnedoEhealthEcosystemIntegrated2021","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Psychosocial interventions for patients with breast cancer (BC) have demonstrated their effectiveness at reducing emotional distress and improving quality of life. The current digitisation of screening, monitoring and psychosocial treatment presents the opportunity for a revolution that could improve the quality of care and reduce its economic burden. The objectives of this study are, first, to assess the effectiveness of an e-health platform with integrated and stepped psychosocial services compared with usual psychosocial care, and second, to examine its cost-utility.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups: E-health intervention with integrated and stepped psychosocial services vs usual psychosocial care. An estimated sample of 338 patients with BC in the acute survival phase will be recruited from three university hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) and will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. All participants will be evaluated at the beginning of the study (T1: recruitment), 3 months from T1 (T2), 6 months from T1 (T3) and 12 months from T1 (T4). Primary outcome measures will include number of clinical cases detected, waiting time from detection to psychosocial intervention and proportion of cases successfully treated in the different steps of the intervention, as well as outcomes related to emotional distress, quality of life, post-traumatic stress and growth, treatment adherence and therapeutic alliance. Secondary outcomes will include the acceptability of the platform, patients' satisfaction and usability. For the cost-utility analysis, we will assess quality-adjusted life years and costs related to healthcare utilisation, medication use and adherence, work absenteeism and infrastructure-related and transport-related costs.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Institut Català d'Oncologia network in Hospitalet, Spain.

In Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) as formulated by Aaron T.

Alliance ruptures can therefore have a detrimental effect on therapy if left unrepaired. This article contributes to the In-Session issue on rupture repairs by outlining the role of the alliance as a component of the therapeutic relationship in CBT and illustrates how ruptures can be identified and effectively resolved through detailed case examples.

  {"id":"okaneDevelopmentTherapeuticAlliance2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the promising benefits of self-guided digital interventions for adolescents recovering from concussion, attrition rates for such interventions are high. Evidence suggests that adults can develop therapeutic alliance with self-guided digital interventions, which is in turn associated with intervention engagement. However, no research has examined whether adolescents develop therapeutic alliance with self-guided digital interventions and what factors are important to its development. Additionally, social presence-the extent to which digital encounters feel like they are occurring in person-may be another relevant factor to understanding the nature of the connection between adolescents and a self-guided digital intervention, though this has yet to be explored.\nOBJECTIVE: This qualitative study explored the extent to which adolescents recovering from concussion developed therapeutic alliance and social presence during their use of a self-guided digital mindfulness-based intervention. Additionally, this study aimed to determine factors important to adolescents' development of therapeutic alliance and social presence with the intervention.\nMETHODS: Adolescents aged between 12 and 17.99 years who sustained a concussion were recruited from 2 sites: a pediatric emergency department up to 48 hours after a concussion and a tertiary care clinic over 1 month following a concussion to capture adolescents who had both acute and persisting symptoms after concussion. Participants (N=10) completed a 4-week mindfulness-based intervention delivered through a smartphone app. Within the app, participants listened to audio recordings of mindfulness guides (voice actors) narrating psychoeducation and mindfulness practices. At 4 weeks, participants completed questionnaires and a semistructured interview exploring their experience of therapeutic alliance and social presence with the mindfulness guides in the intervention.\nRESULTS: Themes identified within the qualitative results revealed that participants developed therapeutic alliance and social presence by \"developing a genuine connection\" with their mindfulness guides and \"sensing real people.\" Particularly important to the development of therapeutic alliance and social presence were the mindfulness guides' \"personal backgrounds and voices,\" such that participants felt more connected to the guides by knowing information about them and through the guides' calm tone of voice in audio recordings. Quantitative findings supported qualitative results; participants' average score for therapeutic alliance was far above the scale midpoint, while the mixed results for social presence measures aligned with qualitative findings that participants felt that the mindfulness guides seemed real but not quite as real as an in-person connection would.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that adolescents can develop therapeutic alliance and social presence when using digital interventions with no direct human contact. Adolescents' development of therapeutic alliance and social presence with self-guided digital interventions can be bolstered by increasing human-like qualities (eg, real voices) within interventions. Maximizing therapeutic alliance and social presence may be a promising way to reduce attrition in self-guided digital interventions while providing accessible treatment.","author":[{"family":"O'Kane","given":"Kiarah M.

  {"id":"oplandPsychotherapyTherapeuticRelationship2025","abstract":"Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, is a treatment intervention used to help individuals manage and overcome a range of emotional, psychological, and behavioral issues. This treatment involves structured conversations between a therapist and a client to explore thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, ultimately promoting mental well-being. Various psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and humanistic therapy, cater to clients' diverse needs and preferences. A critical factor in the success of psychotherapy is the therapeutic relationship, which is the collaborative and trusting bond between the therapist and the client. The therapeutic relationship is also commonly referred to as rapport. The therapeutic relationship is characterized by mutual respect, empathy, and a nonjudgmental attitude, which creates a safe space for clients to discuss their concerns openly. This relationship is a foundation for clients to explore and address their issues, facilitating personal growth and healing. Research has consistently shown that a strong therapeutic alliance is one of the most important predictors of positive treatment outcomes and adherence to healthcare professional recommendations.

Twelve experienced therapists from the U.S., Spain and Australia were interviewed in depth about their experiences of this transition, particularly how they developed and maintained therapeutic alliances in a virtual context with couples and families suffering pandemic-related hardships. The qualitative analysis identified 40 themes reflecting participants' initial impressions of telehealth and their positive and negative reactions and adjustments to practicing remotely. Upon overcoming some initial wariness about providing services virtually, many participants described advantages to this way of working with families. Indeed, participants were creative in adjusting to this novel therapy modality, finding new ways to connect emotionally with their clients, to work meaningfully with children, to assess in-session dynamics, and to ensure their clients' privacy and safety. Notably, several participants commented on the relatively slower development of alliances with new cases and the challenge of repairing split alliances between family members. Many of these difficulties were described as due to having minimal access to their clients' raw emotions and the inability to use typical systemic interventions, such as moving family members around physically. Participants also reflected on being a \"participant observer\" to the upheaval caused by the pandemic, a distressing experience they shared with the families in their care.","author":[{"family":"Orlowski","given":"Edmund W."},{"family":"Friedlander","given":"Myrna L."},{"family":"Megale","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Emily K."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Shayne R."}],"citation-key":"orlowskiCoupleFamilyTherapists2022","container-title":"Contemporary Family Therapy","container-title-short":"Contemp Fam Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s10591-022-09640-x","ISSN":"0892-2764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"101-114","PMCID":"PMC8978774","PMID":"35400810","source":"PubMed","title":"Couple and family therapists' experiences with Telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a phenomenological analysis","title-short":"Couple and family therapists' experiences with Telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

Drawing on recent evidence, we examined recovery-associated factors and integrated these insights into a structured diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm.\nRESULTS: FMD primarily affects women and typically presents with tremor, weakness, or mixed motor symptoms. Phenotypic heterogeneity is common; non-motor symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and psychiatric comorbidities contribute to clinical complexity. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies reveal salience, interoception, and motor network disruptions, often involving the amygdala, sensorimotor cortex, and temporoparietal junction. Diagnosis relies on positive clinical signs rather than exclusion. A five-phase diagnostic framework is recommended, including neurological examination, patient-centred communication, and multidisciplinary engagement. Treatment requires an individualized approach combining physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, neuromodulation, pharmacotherapy, and digital tools. Prognosis varies, but early diagnosis, a strong therapeutic alliance, and patient confidence in recovery improve outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: FMD is a multisystem disorder requiring integrated, personalized, and humanized care.

  {"id":"oudshoornMeasuringWorkingAlliance2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The establishment of a valuable and meaningful working alliance between people with mild intellectual disabilities (IDs) and healthcare professionals is critically important for improving both the quality of life and impact of therapy for people with mild IDs. Measuring the working alliance as a treatment or support component is therefore of utmost relevance. In light of the increased use of eHealth tools, it is also essential to measure the alliance using these tools, which is referred to as technical alliance. There was a lack of validation of these two measurements for healthcare professionals working with people with mild IDs, which this study sought to address.\nMETHOD: Both the validated Working Alliance Inventory - Short Form - MID (WAI-SF-MID) and Technical Alliance Inventory - Short Form - MID (TAI-SF-MID) for general patient populations were adapted for healthcare professionals working with people with mild IDs. A two-step approach was conducted to systematically adapt both measurements with an expert group of healthcare professionals. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test a three-factor structure for both the WAI-SF-MID (N = 199) and the TAI-SF-MID (N = 139), and internal consistency was determined for both scales.\nRESULTS: An acceptable-to-good model fit was found for both the WAI-SF-MID and the TAI-SF-MID; confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a three-factor model for both measurements.

A structured manual was developed and optimized based on a pilot study's manual, a scoping review of existing literature and manuals, exchange with experts, the team's clinical experience of working with compassion-focused interventions, and the principles of ecological momentary interventions. This analysis focuses on the experimental condition receiving the EMIcompass intervention.\nRESULTS: A total of 46 young individuals were randomized to the experimental condition. There was evidence for initial signals of effects of age (B=0.11, 95% CI 0.00-0.22), general psychopathology (B=0.08, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.16), and clinical stage (B=1.50, 95% CI 0.06-2.93) on change in momentary self-compassion and change in emotion regulation from baseline to postintervention assessments. There was no evidence for associations of other baseline characteristics (eg, gender, minority status, and level of functioning) and putative mechanisms (eg, overall self-compassion, working alliance, and training frequency). In addition, except for an initial signal for an association of momentary self-compassion at baseline and psychological distress (B=-2.83, 95% CI -5.66 to 0.00), we found no evidence that baseline characteristics related to clinical outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated the reach of participants by the intervention largely independent of sociodemographic, clinical, and functional baseline characteristics. The findings need to be confirmed in a definitive trial.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register NDRKS00017265; https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00017265.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/27462.","author":[{"family":"Paetzold","given":"Isabell"},{"family":"Schick","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Rauschenberg","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Hirjak","given":"Dusan"},{"family":"Banaschewski","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Meyer-Lindenberg","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Butz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Floesser","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Schueltke","given":"Leonie"},{"family":"Boehnke","given":"Jan Rasmus"},{"family":"Boecking","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Reininghaus","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"paetzoldHybridEcologicalMomentary2022","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/39511","ISSN":"2561-326X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"e39511","PMCID":"PMC9675017","PMID":"36331526","source":"PubMed","title":"A Hybrid Ecological Momentary Compassion-Focused Intervention for Enhancing Resilience in Help-Seeking Young People: Prospective Study of Baseline Characteristics in the EMIcompass Trial","title-short":"A Hybrid Ecological Momentary Compassion-Focused Intervention for Enhancing Resilience in Help-Seeking Young People","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"pandarakalamDigitalPsychiatryImplications2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased burden on all medical services and healthcare professionals are applying new strategies to cope with the added demands. During the pandemic mental healthcare services in many parts of the world have been reorganised to incorporate modern technology and maintain efficient service delivery. Mental health professionals are playing a major role in alleviating the suffering resulting from this pandemic. A selective survey of the literature, including narrative reviews, was carried out to study the implications of digital psychiatry. Historically, epidemics have had a substantial effect on mental health and general health services. Telehealth appears to be the right solution to the present mental health crisis, but technology cannot substitute for human presence and proximity in mental health services, so the newer interventions have advantages and disadvantages. Remote methods of therapy are likely to continue to be used and proper assessment of these new ways of working in psychiatry is required. In the post-pandemic period, the challenge will be to combine digital and in-person therapies. Discussions about digital revolution in the field of psychiatry should be modified to digital evolution.","author":[{"family":"Pandarakalam","given":"James P."}],"citation-key":"pandarakalamDigitalPsychiatryImplications2021","container-title":"British Journal of Hospital Medicine (London, England: 2005)","container-title-short":"Br J Hosp Med (Lond)","DOI":"10.12968/hmed.2021.0382","ISSN":"1750-8460","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-10","PMID":"34983228","source":"PubMed","title":"Digital psychiatry: implications for patients and services","title-short":"Digital psychiatry","type":"article-journal","volume":"82"},

This study investigated the impact of a novel, research-informed training protocol that integrated elements of alliance-focused training (AFT) and facilitative interpersonal skills (FIS). Beyond traditional training techniques of didactics and lecture, the AFT/FIS intervention incorporated empirically supported video simulations of therapy, which were reinforced by role plays and deliberate practice on key therapeutic interpersonal skills. Fifty-eight graduate-level therapy trainees and professional therapists from various helping fields were randomized to one of two brief trainings in a multi-site RCT: (i) the AFT/FIS workshop or (ii) a more traditional demonstration training (DT) workshop. Participants were assessed on critical, relational therapeutic skills before and after the training. After controlling for relevant covariates, participants in the AFT/FIS training saw a marginally higher post-intervention level of overall therapeutic skills. Subsequent exploratory analyses revealed AFT/FIS participants also had significantly higher levels of specifically targeted post-training therapist skills (i.e., empathy, alliance bond capacity, and alliance rupture-repair responsiveness) compared to participants in DT.

  {"id":"petersenStaffExperiencesEncountering2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: High comorbidity exists between mental illness and substance use disorders (SUD). Patients in psychiatry living with problematic alcohol or drug consumption can experience a sense of exclusion, where seeking help for SUD can be perceived as stigmatizing. The aim of this study is to illuminate staff experiences of encountering patients with SUD within the psychiatric outpatient context.\nMETHODS: The study was exploratory, with a qualitative design. Interviews with outpatient psychiatry managers and focus groups with clinical staff focused on the experience of encountering patients with SUD. Data were evaluated using content analysis inspired by phenomenological-hermeneutic methodology.\nRESULTS: Three themes were identified and each illuminated by two sub-themes. Bridging the organizational gap included sub-themes of having an established collaboration and facing difficulties in the collaboration; Having beliefs about the patient you encounter included sub-themes of working with patients who are exposed to prejudicial thoughts and expressing prejudicial thoughts about the patient. Striving to achieve a therapeutic alliance included sub-themes of having a feeling of developing together and supporting the patient towards recovery.\nCONCLUSION: A life-world perspective, used to interpret results, indicated that caring for patients with SUD in psychiatry was perceived as difficult, where collaboration between psychiatry and addiction care was often experienced as problematic. Based on these findings, we believe that the current gap between the psychiatry and addiction care could be reduced to some extent by offering patients digital treatment for SUD. In this way, patients could remain under the care of their regular psychiatric clinic without having to physically visit SUD services. Thus, a virtual bridge could be established to bring psychiatry and addiction care closer to each other for the patients' benefit.","author":[{"family":"Petersén","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Thurang","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Berman","given":"Anne H."}],"citation-key":"petersenStaffExperiencesEncountering2021","container-title":"Addiction Science & Clinical Practice","container-title-short":"Addict Sci Clin Pract","DOI":"10.1186/s13722-021-00235-9","ISSN":"1940-0640","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"29","PMCID":"PMC8112046","PMID":"33971959","source":"PubMed","title":"Staff experiences of encountering and treating outpatients with substance use disorder in the psychiatric context: a qualitative study","title-short":"Staff experiences of encountering and treating outpatients with substance use disorder in the psychiatric context","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"petrozziProcessEvaluationMind2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In chronic conditions, such as back pain, the use of interventions that address physical, social and psychological aspects within a biopsychosocial framework are encouraged, however, applying this holistic multimodal approach in physical therapy practice (i.e., chiropractic and physiotherapy) is challenging. To explore the problem of delivering a biopsychosocially informed package of care in physical therapy practice a recent randomised control trial (RCT) called 'Mind Your Back' was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined physical and internet-delivered psychological intervention (psychologically informed physical treatments) compared to standard treatment for improving disability and self-efficacy in people with chronic LBP. The results of the trial indicated no difference between the two intervention groups. Although high-quality RCTs are considered gold standard for effectiveness of interventions, qualitative research methods embedded within a process evaluation framework are also used to reveal other issues and important information that help to explain clinical trial results, and to further the field of digital health interventions research. Therefore, within a process evaluation framework, the aim is to explore participants experiences of the interventions received throughout the Mind Your Back trial which led to a null result.\nMETHODS: In-line with recommendations for a process evaluation this study used in-depth interviews and qualitative thematic analysis with participants of both arms of the trial 5-6 months after study completion. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with twenty-five participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the Mind Your Back trial. Interviews were conducted in November 2017, transcribed verbatim and data analysed thematically.\nRESULTS: Two main themes were identified: (1) Personalised support and therapeutic alliance are important, and (2) MoodGYM lacked relevant, personalised and tailored support.\nCONCLUSION: It is important to deliver tailored digital health supports that is personalised and fosters a therapeutic alliance.","author":[{"family":"Petrozzi","given":"M.

  {"id":"petrymoeckeFirstNationsPeoples2024","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Relationships are the core of Indigenous Peoples' spiritual and cultural identities, and therapeutic relationships are an integral part of the physical rehabilitation process, directly influencing health outcomes. However, participating in therapeutic relationships can be difficult for First Nations Peoples, particularly in the virtual landscape. There is limited understanding of First Nations Peoples' perspectives on this issue, and this understanding is crucial to developing culturally safe and effective telehealth physiotherapy programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the perspectives of First Nations Peoples from British Columbia, Canada, on telehealth physiotherapy, with an emphasis on the virtual therapeutic relationship.\nMETHODS: A narrative qualitative study that utilized one-on-one, semistructured interviews was conducted with 19 First Nations adults from remote and rural First Nations communities in north-central British Columbia, Canada. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using an inductive approach to reflexive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Three themes emerged from data analysis. 'Therapist's attitude and rapport' captures participants' perceptions of what matters the most in how physiotherapists relate to First Nations Peoples and carry out their work. 'Remote nature of virtual care' encompasses the main challenges of virtual care visits, particularly how these were perceived to impact establishing and maintaining solid therapeutic relationships. 'Fostering culturally appropriate and safe telehealth physiotherapy' focuses on what is needed to advance telehealth physiotherapy in a manner that respects and reflects First Nations cultures, equipping all involved parties to provide comprehensive and sensitive services. Our findings advocate a hybrid model that combines in-person and telehealth visits to address communication barriers and the absence of physical interaction. Bridging the digital health literacy gap through training and collaboration with local support staff is crucial (as it is to bridge the possible cultural literary gap of therapists), and the incorporation of cultural elements holds promise for enhancing the engagement and effectiveness of telehealth services in these communities.\nCONCLUSION: The pursuit of equitable health care for First Nations communities demands not only increased access but also a thoughtful, culturally safe, trauma-informed, and holistic approach. This approach must be tailored to the unique needs of First Nations Peoples, emphasizing the integration of cultural elements and community support. A hybrid model combining in-person and telehealth visits is recommended to address logistical challenges and enhance the therapeutic relationship, ensuring that care is both effective and respectful of cultural values and practices.","author":[{"family":"Petry Moecke","given":"Débora"},{"family":"Holyk","given":"Travis"},{"family":"Maddocks","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Kristin L."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Kendall"},{"family":"Camp","given":"Pat G."}],"citation-key":"petrymoeckeFirstNationsPeoples2024","container-title":"Rural and Remote Health","container-title-short":"Rural Remote Health","DOI":"10.22605/RRH9022","ISSN":"1445-6354","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"9022","PMID":"39533817","source":"PubMed","title":"First Nations Peoples' perspectives on telehealth physiotherapy: a qualitative study focused on the therapeutic relationship","title-short":"First Nations Peoples' perspectives on telehealth physiotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"potockyTherapeuticAllianceRefugee2025","abstract":"The therapeutic alliance-a collaborative relationship between mental health/psychosocial support (MHPSS) providers and clients-has consistently demonstrated positive impacts on mental health outcomes. This narrative review focuses on the therapeutic alliance within the context of refugee clients, who face unique challenges stemming from forced displacement, trauma, and systemic barriers. Utilizing a systematic search and thematic synthesis, 20 studies published between 2014 and 2024 were analyzed to address four key questions: the state of knowledge, the role of interpreters, strategies for improvement, and gaps in research. Findings highlight significant challenges in building alliances with refugee clients due to cultural and linguistic differences, power dynamics, and trauma-related distrust. The presence of interpreters transforms the traditional dyadic alliance into a triadic relationship, introducing both benefits and complexities. Interpreters act as co-constructors of the alliance, requiring strong collaboration and role negotiation with providers. Recommendations for strengthening the alliance include flexible therapeutic boundaries, advocacy integration, continuity of care, and tailored training for providers and interpreters. Despite the growing body of research, gaps remain in understanding non-verbal communication, virtual care dynamics, and the perspectives of clients discontinuing therapy. This review emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift recognizing clients, providers, and interpreters as equal partners in therapeutic processes, alongside further exploration of emerging contexts such as telehealth and refugee-led MHPSS initiatives.","author":[{"family":"Potocky","given":"Miriam"}],"citation-key":"potockyTherapeuticAllianceRefugee2025","container-title":"Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health","container-title-short":"J Immigr Minor Health","DOI":"10.1007/s10903-025-01688-9","ISSN":"1557-1920","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"623-630","PMID":"40317432","source":"PubMed","title":"The Therapeutic Alliance in Refugee Mental Health and Psychosocial Support: A Narrative Review","title-short":"The Therapeutic Alliance in Refugee Mental Health and Psychosocial Support","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

I conclude that digital health and SMU are ubiquitous, and can be beneficial if used circumspectly with Hippocratic principles that have been updated for the modern era and are grounded in ancient moral codes. Unfettered SMU however, without adherence to ethical and legal guidelines is problematic, and may expose patients, families and clinicians to significant risk of harm and moral vulnerability. Justifiable, explicit, consistent and regularly reviewed boundaries, both professional and personal, are ethically advisable.

Due to its high prevalence, it constitutes the first cause of disability among the Americas, where only a very low percentage of the population receives the adequate evidence-based psychological treatment. Internet-Based Interventions (IBIs) are a great alternative to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. Although there are several studies in low-and middle-income countries proving IBIs' feasibility and acceptability, there is still little evidence of the effectiveness in diverse social and cultural contexts such as Latin America.\nMETHODS: Two studies will be described: Study 1 is focused on the cultural adaptation of a cognitive-behavioral IBI Smiling is Fun (Botella et al. 2012, 2015) for Ecuadorian population with depression based on the procedure by Salamanca-Sanabria et al. (2018). Study 2 describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary efficacy of the culturally adapted intervention in a Public Health Care setting. A total of 153 patients with mild to moderate degree of depression as assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be randomly assigned to either an IBI group using only automated support by the system; an IBI group including also minimal human support; or a waiting list group. The primary outcome (depression) and secondary outcomes (e.g., anxiety, affect, quality of life) will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

  {"id":"ribeiroObservingWorkingAlliance2021","abstract":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the mental health and alcohol consumption of individuals. Videoconferencing psychotherapy has become a fundamental mode of treatment for people with alcohol use disorders. However, there are still doubts about its effectiveness and the therapeutic relationship. The working alliance is considered a foundation of effective practice in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Observer measurements of the working alliance have demonstrated reliability and meaningful associations with the reduction of symptoms. However, translations of instruments to evaluate the working alliance and examine its construct have not previously been conducted for online psychotherapy for alcohol addiction. This study aimed for the cross-cultural adaptation of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form-Observer (WAI-SR-O) for Brazil and the evaluation of its reliability and evidence of its validity in videoconferencing psychotherapy for alcoholism. The WAI-SR-O was applied by pairs of observers for the evaluation of the working alliance in 19 recorded sessions of videoconferencing psychotherapy of 10 clients with a diagnosis of alcohol addiction. The sessions were also evaluated by the therapist (WAI-T) and client (WAI-C). The WAI-SR-O shows a moderate inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.67) for the general scale, higher ICC for the goals and bond subscales, and a moderate value for the task subscale. The internal consistency was good (a = 0.86). The results show low but significant correlations among the goals and bond subscales of the WAI-SR-O and the general, goals, and bond scales of the WAI-T. No correlations were found with the WAI-C. As the literature points out, the client, therapist, and observer versions of the WAI evaluated the alliance differently, requiring further study. The WAI-SR-O proved to be a reliable and valid measurement for the evaluation of the working alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy for alcohol addiction, becoming an important tool for the study of the working alliance in telepsychotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Nathálya Soares"},{"family":"Colugnati","given":"Fernando Antonio Basile"},{"family":"Kazantzis","given":"Nikolaos"},{"family":"Sartes","given":"Laisa Marcorela Andreoli"}],"citation-key":"ribeiroObservingWorkingAlliance2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647814","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"647814","PMCID":"PMC8438131","PMID":"34531780","source":"PubMed","title":"Observing the Working Alliance in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Alcohol Addiction: Reliability and Validity of the Working Alliance Inventory Short Revised Observer","title-short":"Observing the Working Alliance in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Alcohol Addiction","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

In an online survey, a sample of N=373 Czech psychotherapists and counselors rated a set of relational metaphors in terms of how accurately they depicted their roles in their relationships with their clients. The single most endorsed metaphor for the practitioner's role was a guide. Furthermore, the principal component analysis identified three relational components, namely, Mentor, Resource Supplier, and Remedy Distributor. The associations among these components and multiple practitioners' variables, including demographic and practice-related variables and theoretical orientation, were explored. These three components represent general dimensions of the psychotherapy relationship that cut across various theoretical orientations and, thus, define psychotherapy relationships in a general sense.","author":[{"family":"Řiháček","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Roubal","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Motalová","given":"Katarína"}],"citation-key":"rihacekFacetsPsychotherapyRelationship2020","container-title":"Research in Psychotherapy (Milano)","container-title-short":"Res Psychother","DOI":"10.4081/ripppo.2020.468","ISSN":"2239-8031","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,31]]},"language":"eng","page":"468","PMCID":"PMC7875073","PMID":"33585293","source":"PubMed","title":"Facets of the psychotherapy relationship: a metaphorical approach","title-short":"Facets of the psychotherapy relationship","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"roberEmotionRegulationFamily2023","abstract":"Outcome research highlights the importance of the therapeutic alliance for the outcome of therapy. Meta-analyses suggest that in family therapy, the therapeutic alliance is even more important than in individual therapy. In family therapy, however, the alliance is more complex than in individual therapy. Through empathy, authenticity and hopefulness the therapist can contribute to an effective alliance. Sometimes during the session, a therapist may experience strong emotions that are in tension with his/her therapeutic aspirations of empathetic listening, authenticity and hopefulness. A therapist might experience boredom instead of curiosity, irritation instead of acceptance, shame instead of authenticity. There is need for some kind of emotion regulation to protect the alliance. Furthermore, as some authors suggest, the therapist's emotions - even the emotions that are first glance seem harmful to the alliance - may also be useful for the therapist. Several case stories illustrate the different ways in which family therapists can deal with their emotions in the session.","author":[{"family":"Rober","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"roberEmotionRegulationFamily2023","container-title":"Family Process","container-title-short":"Fam Process","DOI":"10.1111/famp.12937","ISSN":"1545-5300","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"1307-1321","PMID":"37658754","source":"PubMed","title":"Emotion regulation of the family therapist","type":"article-journal","volume":"62"},
  {"id":"rodolicoDevelopingSTEPSEQualitative2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia treatment with antipsychotics often results in side effects that impact adherence and quality of life. Managing these effects remains challenging, as it requires balancing efficacy and tolerability. The Schizophrenia Technological Evaluation of Patient Side Effects (STEP-SE) app aims to aid side effects monitoring and management through shared decision-making (SDM).\nAIM: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of the STEP-SE app for patients and clinicians in managing antipsychotic side effects.\nMETHODS: Sixteen stable outpatients and 14 psychiatrists participated in semi-structured interviews after using the STEP-SE app. Questions explored ease of use, information clarity, user needs fulfilment, patient-clinician collaboration, treatment adherence improvement, patient empowerment and clinical utility. Data were analysed thematically.\nRESULTS: Overall satisfaction with STEP-SE was high. Both groups found that the tool improved patient involvement, provided reliable information to enhance therapeutic alliance, posed low risks of misunderstanding and had an intuitive interface. Patients felt more motivated and empowered. Clinicians appreciated guideline consistency. Preferences differed regarding data visualization formats.\nDISCUSSION: STEP-SE shows potential for aiding SDM on antipsychotic side effects. Patients gained motivation, and clinicians felt reassured. Refinements around mobile access, graphics and features could augment utility. Generalizability is limited given the stable patient sample.\nCONCLUSION: Preliminary findings suggest that STEP-SE effectively engages patients, empowers them and supports clinicians in collaborative side effect management. Further testing with diverse user groups is warranted.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The current study was designed to gather patient and public feedback for the development of our decision aid tool, STEP-SE. Participants interacted with the tool's prototype in interactive sessions, providing insights and identifying technical issues. Their feedback was crucial for enhancing the tool, with each suggestion and bug report carefully considered for future iterations. The participants' contributions were key in optimizing STEP-SE's features and ensuring its relevance and reliability.

  {"id":"rubeisWhoBenefitsApp2020","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The use of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) is often considered as empowerment of patients and improvement of accessibility of mental health services. Risks for specific patient groups are seldom discussed. Aim of the study is to identify patient groups that do not benefit from IMIs given the tension between autonomy and patient well-being.\nMETHODS: The ethical analysis is based on available empirical evidence (randomized control trials - RCTs, reviews) as well as ethical papers. Methodological background is the tension between patient autonomy and patient well-being, which is crucial to the therapeutic alliance. On this foundation, patient groups are identified that do not benefit from IMIs in terms of empowerment or accessibility.\nRESULTS: The evidence-based ethical analysis shows that patients with certain disorders or high symptom severity, patients with low level of education or a lack of technical skills, and patients with a migrant background do often not benefit from IMIs. Risks of IMIs are a lack of individualization of interventions given individual treatment needs, symptom deterioration, higher dropout-rate, and insufficient identification of emergency situations.\nDISCUSSION: Overemphasizing autonomy may compromize patient well-being in certain patient groups. This may lead to a situation where those patient groups whose inclusion into mental health service should be facilitated by IMIs might not be reached. These access barriers should be considered when designing IMIs, so that multimorbid marginalized groups are not forgotten in the necessary digitalization of the health market.\nCONCLUSION: The application of IMIs depends on the individual resources of the patient. Should IMIs be further implemented within the German mental healthcare system, it is imperative that the patient well-being of those patient groups that do not benefit from IMIs is guaranteed. In addition, an early focus on marginalized groups may and the implementation of low-level access to counselling and treatment may provide chances for said groups.","author":[{"family":"Rubeis","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Ketteler","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"rubeisWhoBenefitsApp2020","container-title":"Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, Medizinische Psychologie","container-title-short":"Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol","DOI":"10.1055/a-1104-5459","ISSN":"1439-1058","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"ger","page":"467-474","PMID":"32069513","source":"PubMed","title":"[Who Benefits from the App?

To address this critical knowledge gap, we leveraged feature extraction methods from natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence, to quantify pronoun and non-fluency language markers that are relevant for communicative and emotional aspects of therapeutic relationships. From twenty-eight transcripts of non-manualized psychotherapy sessions recorded in outpatient clinics, we identified therapists' first-person pronoun usage frequency and patients' speech transition marking relaxed interaction style as potential metrics of alliance. Behavioral data from patients who played an economic game that measures social exchange (i.e. trust game) suggested that therapists' first-person pronoun usage may influence alliance ratings through their diminished trusting behavior toward therapists. Together, this work supports that communicative language features in patient-therapist dialogues could be markers of alliance.","author":[{"family":"Ryu","given":"Jihan"},{"family":"Heisig","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Katz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mayberg","given":"Helen S."},{"family":"Gu","given":"Xiaosi"}],"citation-key":"ryuNaturalLanguageProcessing2023","container-title":"iScience","container-title-short":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2023.106860","ISSN":"2589-0042","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,16]]},"language":"eng","page":"106860","PMCID":"PMC10225921","PMID":"37255661","source":"PubMed","title":"A natural language processing approach reveals first-person pronoun usage and non-fluency as markers of therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

Its use in this field will inevitably change clinical practice, the patient-caregiver relationship and the concept of the diagnosis and treatment pathway, affecting the balance between the patient's right to self-determination and health, and thus leading to an evolution of the concept of informed consent. The aim was to characterize the guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence, its areas of application and the relevant legislation, to propose guiding principles for the design of optimal informed consent for its use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A classic review by keywords on the main search engines was conducted. An analysis of the guidelines and regulations issued by scientific authorities and legal bodies on the use of artificial intelligence in public health was carried out.\nRESULTS: The current areas of application of this technology were highlighted, divided into sectors, its impact on them, as well as a summary of current guidelines and legislation.\nDISCUSSION: The ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the health care system were assessed, particularly regarding the therapeutic alliance between doctor and patient, and the balance between the right to self-determination and health. Finally, given the evolution of informed consent in relation to the use of this new technology, seven guiding principles were proposed to guarantee the right to the most informed consent or dissent.","author":[{"family":"Saccà","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Turrini","given":"Rachele"},{"family":"Ausania","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Turrina","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"De Leo","given":"Domenico"}],"citation-key":"saccaMenageTroisHealthcare2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Medicine","container-title-short":"Front Med (Lausanne)","DOI":"10.3389/fmed.2023.1329087","ISSN":"2296-858X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1329087","PMCID":"PMC10807288","PMID":"38269319","source":"PubMed","title":"The ménage à trois of healthcare: the actors in after-AI era under patient consent","title-short":"The ménage à trois of healthcare","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"sagui-hensonUnderstandingComponentsTherapeutic2022","abstract":"Digital mental health services leverage technology to increase access to care, yet less is known about the quality of therapeutic relationships in a virtual setting. This study examined components of therapeutic alliance (a mechanism underlying successful treatment) and its association with beneficial treatment outcomes in a real-world, virtual setting. The objective is to examine (1) participant ratings of components of therapeutic alliance with providers in a virtual setting, (2) changes in subjective well-being and depressive symptoms among participants who began care with elevated depressive symptoms, and (3) the association between components of alliance and changes in participants' well-being. Adults (N = 3,087, M age = 36 ± 9 years, 54% female) across the world with access to digital mental health benefits who engaged in videoconference sessions with a licensed therapist (18%, 555/3,087), certified coach (65%, 2,003/3,087), or both (17%, 529/3,087) between Sept. 29, 2020 and Oct. 12, 21. Participants completed 2 adapted items from the Working Alliance Inventory (goals and bonds subscales) after each session, and ratings were averaged across visits (Cronbach's ɑ = .72). Participants' World Health Organization-Five (WHO-5) Well-Being Index scores at the start and end of the study period were used to measure changes in subjective well-being. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted to examine average alliance ratings across demographics and utilization types and the association between alliance and well-being. The median adapted therapeutic alliance score was 4.8 (range: 1-5) and did not differ by age, country, or baseline well-being (Ps > .07). Females reported higher components of alliance than males (4.88 vs. 4.67, P = .01). Participants utilizing telecoaching reported higher components of alliance than those utilizing teletherapy or both telecoaching and teletherapy (4.83 v. 4.75, P = .004), though effect sizes were negligible. Among those with elevated baseline depressive symptoms (n = 835), participants reported an average WHO-5 increase of 15.42 points (95% CI 14.19-16.65, P < .001, Cohen d = 1.06) with 58% (485/835) reporting clinical recovery and 57% (481/835) reporting clinical improvement in depressive symptoms. Higher components of therapeutic alliance scores predicted greater well-being at follow-up (b = 2.04, 95% CI 0.09-3.99, P = .04) after controlling for age, sex, baseline WHO-5, and number of days in care (R 2  = .06, P < .001). Exploratory analyses indicated this association did not differ by utilization type, baseline well-being, or session utilization (Ps > .34). People with access to one-on-one videoconferencing care via a digital mental health benefit formed a strong bond and sense of alignment on goals with both coaches and therapists. Higher components of alliance scores were associated with improvements in subjective well-being among participants who began care with elevated depressive symptoms, providing evidence that a positive bond and goal alignment with a provider are two of many factors influencing virtual care outcomes. Continued focus on the quality of therapeutic relationships will ensure digital mental health services are patient-tailored as these platforms expand equitable access to evidence-based care.","author":[{"family":"Sagui-Henson","given":"Sara J."},{"family":"Welcome Chamberlain","given":"Camille E."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Brooke J."},{"family":"Li","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Castro Sweet","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"Altman","given":"Myra"}],"citation-key":"sagui-hensonUnderstandingComponentsTherapeutic2022","container-title":"Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science","container-title-short":"J Technol Behav Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s41347-022-00263-5","ISSN":"2366-5963","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"439-450","PMCID":"PMC9278317","PMID":"35855977","source":"PubMed","title":"Understanding Components of Therapeutic Alliance and Well-Being from Use of a Global Digital Mental Health Benefit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Observational Study","title-short":"Understanding Components of Therapeutic Alliance and Well-Being from Use of a Global Digital Mental Health Benefit During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

In this commentary, we suggest that manual therapists should also add telehealth to their toolbox. Thus, we aim to discuss the use of telehealth by manual therapists caring for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.\nMAIN BODY: Telehealth can be delivered to the patient in different modes, such as real-time clinical contact or asynchronously. Platforms vary from websites and smartphone apps to virtual reality systems. Telehealth may be an effective approach, especially for improving pain and function in people with musculoskeletal pain, and it has the potential to reduce the individual and socioeconomic burden of musculoskeletal conditions. However, the certainty of evidence reported in systematic reviews is often low. Factors such as convenience, flexibility, undivided attention from the clinician, user-friendly platforms, goal setting, and use of evidence-based information are all enablers for telehealth use and improving patients' knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-management. Barriers to widening the use of telehealth in musculoskeletal care include the reliability of technology, data privacy issues, difficult to build therapeutic alliance, one-size-fits-all approaches, digital health literacy, and payment models.\nCONCLUSION: We suggest that practitioners of manual medicine make telehealth part of their clinical toolbox where it makes sense and where there is evidence that it is beneficial for people who seek their care.","author":[{"family":"Saragiotto","given":"Bruno T."},{"family":"Sandal","given":"Louise F."},{"family":"Hartvigsen","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"saragiottoCanYouBe2022","container-title":"Chiropractic & Manual Therapies","container-title-short":"Chiropr Man Therap","DOI":"10.1186/s12998-022-00457-x","ISSN":"2045-709X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"48","PMCID":"PMC9664669","PMID":"36376968","source":"PubMed","title":"Can you be a manual therapist without using your hands?","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Data visualization is critical to ensuring applications of digital signals and biomarkers are more informed, ethical, and impactful. But little is known about how sharing of these data, especially at different levels from raw data through proposed biomarkers, impacts patients' perceptions.\nMETHODS: We compared five different graphs generated from data created by the open source mindLAMP app that reflected different ways to share data, from raw data through digital biomarkers and correlation matrices. All graphs were shown to 28 participants, and the graphs' usability was measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS). Additionally, participants were asked about their comfort sharing different kinds of data, administered the Digital Working Alliance Inventory (D-WAI), and asked if they would want to use these visualizations with care providers.\nRESULTS: Of the five graphs shown to participants, the graph visualizing change in survey responses over the course of a week received the highest usability score, with the graph showing multiple metrics changing over a week receiving the lowest usability score. Participants were significantly more likely to be willing to share Global Positioning System data after viewing the graphs, and 25 of 28 participants agreed that they would like to use these graphs to communicate with their clinician.\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Data visualizations can help participants and patients understand digital biomarkers and increase trust in how they are created. As digital biomarkers become more complex, simple visualizations may fail to capture their multiple dimensions, and new interactive data visualizations may be necessary to help realize their full value.","author":[{"family":"Scheuer","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Torous","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"scheuerUsableDataVisualization2022","container-title":"Digital Biomarkers","container-title-short":"Digit Biomark","DOI":"10.1159/000525888","ISSN":"2504-110X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"98-106","PMCID":"PMC9719035","PMID":"36471766","source":"PubMed","title":"Usable Data Visualization for Digital Biomarkers: An Analysis of Usability, Data Sharing, and Clinician Contact","title-short":"Usable Data Visualization for Digital Biomarkers","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"schnitzerUnderstandingEngagementBehaviors2022","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Though telephone counseling is a modality commonly used to promote health behavior change, including tobacco cessation, specific counselor and participant behaviors that indicate engagement and therapeutic alliance remain poorly characterized in the literature. We sought to explore smokers' and counselors' engagement and rapport-building behaviors in telephone counseling for smoking cessation and patterns of these behaviors by smokers' psychiatric symptoms.\nMETHODS: The study team transcribed, audio-recorded tobacco cessation counseling calls for the presence of engagement and rapport-building behaviors among recently hospitalized participants enrolled in a smoking cessation randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study used baseline data from the RCT to explore frequencies of counselors' and smokers' behaviors among smokers who had reported more (vs. fewer) symptoms of depression (PHQ8 ≥ 10) or anxiety (GAD7 ≥ 10) at study entry.\nRESULTS: Participants (n = 37) were mostly female (23/37), White (26/37), with a median age of 58. At study entry while hospitalized, moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (18/37) and anxiety (22/37) were common. Participant-led engagement behaviors included referencing past quit attempts, asking questions, elaborating response to yes/no questions, expressing commitment to behavior change, and assigning importance to nonautomated calls. Counselor-led behaviors included building off prior interaction, empathy, normalizing challenges, reframing and summarizing, validating achievements, and expressing shared experience. Both participants and counselors engaged via general discussion and humor. Participant-led engagement behaviors appeared more often in call transcripts among patients with higher baseline depression and anxiety symptoms compared to those with lower symptom scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study classified participant-led, counselor-led, and shared engagement behaviors during tobacco cessation counseling calls. Increased engagement via telephone counseling may be important for individuals with psychiatric symptoms identified at the start of treatment.","author":[{"family":"Schnitzer","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Senft","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Tindle","given":"Hilary A."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Jennifer H.

  {"id":"schoenenbergEmpathyWorkingAlliance2024","abstract":"Objective Video-based therapy has been used increasingly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, video-based initial psychotherapeutic contact can be problematic due to the limitations of computer-mediated communication. At present, little is known about the effects of video first contact on important psychotherapeutic processes. Method: Forty-three individuals (nvideo = 18, nface-to-face = 25) were recruited via an outpatient clinic waiting list and were randomly assigned to video or face-to-face initial psychotherapeutic sessions. Participants rated treatment expectancy before and after the session, and the therapist's empathy, working alliance, and credibility after the session and several days later. Results: Empathy and working alliance ratings of patients and therapists were high and did not differ between the two communication conditions after the appointment or at follow-up. Treatment expectancy increased to a similar extent for the video and face-to-face modalities from pre to post. Willingness to continue with video-based therapy increased in participants who had video contact, but not in those with face-to-face contact. Conclusion: This study indicates that crucial processes related to the therapeutic relationship can be initiated via video, without prior face-to-face contact. Given the limited nonverbal communication cues in video appointments, it remains unclear as to how such processes evolve.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00031262..","author":[{"family":"Schoenenberg","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Alexandra"}],"citation-key":"schoenenbergEmpathyWorkingAlliance2024","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research: Journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","container-title-short":"Psychother Res","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2023.2233685","ISSN":"1468-4381","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"626-637","PMID":"37436800","source":"PubMed","title":"Empathy, working alliance, treatment expectancy and credibility in video and face-to-face psychotherapeutic first contact","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

Personalizing psychotherapy by algorithm-based modular procedures promises improved outcomes, greater flexibility, and a better fit between research and practice. However, evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of modular-based psychotherapy, using a personalized treatment algorithm, is lacking. This proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 adult outpatients with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder, a score higher than 18 on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24), at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), a history of at least \"moderate to severe\" childhood maltreatment on at least one domain of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and exceeding the cut-off value on at least one of three measures of early trauma-related transdiagnostic mechanisms: the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (RSQ), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-16 (DERS-16). Patients were randomized to 20 sessions of either standard cognitive-behavioral therapy alone (CBT) or CBT plus transdiagnostic modules according to a mechanism-based treatment algorithm (MoBa), over 16 weeks. We aimed to assess the feasibility of MoBa, and to compare MoBa vs. CBT with respect to participants' and therapists' overall satisfaction and ratings of therapeutic alliance (using the Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised, WAI-SR), efficacy, impact on early trauma-related transdiagnostic mechanisms, and safety. The primary outcome for efficacy was the HRSD-24 score at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included, among others, the rate of response (defined as a reduction of the HRSD-24 score by at least 50% from baseline and a score <16 at post-treatment), the rate of remission (defined as a HRSD-24 score ≤8 at post-treatment), and improvements in early trauma-related mechanisms of social threat response, hyperarousal, and social processes/empathy. We found no difficulties in the selection of the transdiagnostic modules in the individual patients, applying the above-mentioned cut-offs, and in the implementation of MoBa. Both participants and therapists reported higher overall satisfaction and had higher WAI-SR ratings with MoBa than CBT. Both approaches led to major reductions of depressive symptoms at post-treatment, with a non-significant superiority of MoBa over CBT. Patients randomized to MoBa were nearly three times as likely to experience remission at the end of therapy (29.4% vs. 11.4%; odds ratio, OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 0.9-11.6). Among mechanism-based outcomes, MoBa patients showed a significantly higher post-treatment effect on social processes/empathy (p<0.05) compared to CBT patients, who presented an exacerbation on this domain at post-treatment. Substantially less adverse events were reported for MoBa compared to CBT. These results suggest the feasibility and acceptability of an algorithm-based modular psychotherapy complementing CBT in depressed patients with psychiatric comorbidities and early trauma. While initial evidence of efficacy was observed, potential clinical advantages and interindividual heterogeneity in treatment outcomes will have to be investigated in fully powered confirmation trials.","author":[{"family":"Schramm","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Elsaesser","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"Jenkner","given":"Carolin"},{"family":"Hautzinger","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Herpertz","given":"Sabine C."}],"citation-key":"schrammAlgorithmbasedModularPsychotherapy2024","container-title":"World psychiatry: official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)","container-title-short":"World Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1002/wps.21204","ISSN":"1723-8617","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"257-266","PMCID":"PMC11083959","PMID":"38727062","source":"PubMed","title":"Algorithm-based modular psychotherapy vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy for patients with depression, psychiatric comorbidities and early trauma: a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial","title-short":"Algorithm-based modular psychotherapy vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy for patients with depression, psychiatric comorbidities and early trauma","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"schulerExaminingTelemedicineBasedVirtual2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) has strong potential to enhance the effectiveness of telemental health care (TMH) by providing accessible, personalized treatment from home. While there is ample research supporting VR for in-person treatment, there is only preliminary data on the efficacy of telemedicine-based VR. Furthermore, the majority of VR apps used in therapy are not designed for mental health care. VR has the potential to enhance TMH through innovative technology solutions designed specifically for the enhancement of remotely delivered evidence-based practices. This feasibility randomized controlled efficacy trial aims to fill both of these gaps by piloting a novel telemedicine-based VR app (Doxy.me VR) equipped with animal phobia exposure stimuli.\nOBJECTIVE: This is a feasibility randomized controlled efficacy trial comparing exposure therapy via a telemedicine-based VR clinic versus standard TMH with adults with an intense fear of dogs, snakes, or spiders. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of a fully powered trial. The secondary objective is to conduct a preliminary examination of clinical outcomes (eg, specific phobia symptoms).\nMETHODS: This single-site trial will enroll a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 60 adults with self-reported fear of dogs, snakes, or spiders. Potential participants will be recruited through clinical trial and research recruitment websites and posting flyers. All self-report assessments and homework will be partially automated using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) forms and surveys, but the baseline assessment of phobia symptoms and exposure intervention will be administered by the study therapist.\nRESULTS: The feasibility of the proposed trial methodology will be assessed using enrollment, retention, assessment completion, and treatment protocol fidelity benchmarks. Between-group differences in specific phobia, anxiety, and depression symptoms while covarying for pretreatment scores, will be conducted using repeated measures ANOVA along with differences in therapeutic alliance and presence. Data obtained from these analyses will inform power analyses for a fully powered efficacy trial. In total, 54 participants were randomized between October 25, 2023, and July 26, 2024 (Doxy.me VR n=28 and TMH n=26). Data analysis will be completed and submitted by the end of the second quarter of 2025.\nCONCLUSIONS: This feasibility randomized controlled trial comparing Doxy.me VR versus TMH aims to enhance the delivery of evidence-based treatments via telemedicine and reduce barriers to remotely delivered exposure therapy.

The adoption of CAI poses many risks that need in-depth ethical scrutiny. The objective of this paper is to complement current research on the ethics of AI for mental health by proposing a holistic, ethical, and epistemic analysis of CAI adoption. First, we focus on the question of whether CAI is rather a tool or an agent. This question serves as a framework for the subsequent ethical analysis of CAI focusing on topics of (self-) knowledge, (self-)understanding, and relationships. Second, we propose further conceptual and ethical analysis regarding human-AI interaction and argue that CAI cannot be considered as an equal partner in a conversation as is the case with a human therapist. Instead, CAI's role in a conversation should be restricted to specific functions.","author":[{"family":"Sedlakova","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Trachsel","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"sedlakovaConversationalArtificialIntelligence2023","container-title":"The American journal of bioethics: AJOB","container-title-short":"Am J Bioeth","DOI":"10.1080/15265161.2022.2048739","ISSN":"1536-0075","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"4-13","PMID":"35362368","source":"PubMed","title":"Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Psychotherapy: A New Therapeutic Tool or Agent?","title-short":"Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"sekulaVirtualRealityModerator2022","abstract":"Psychotherapy with the use of psychedelic substances, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ketamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), has demonstrated promise in treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, addiction, and treatment-resistant depression. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PP) represents a unique psychopharmacological model that leverages the profound effects of the psychedelic experience. That experience is characterized by strong dependency on two key factors: participant mindset and the therapeutic environment. As such, therapeutic models that utilize psychedelics reflect the need for careful design that promotes an open, flexible, trusting mindset and a supportive setting. To meet this need, the PP model is increasingly supplemented by auxiliary methods, including meditation, relaxation, visualization or spiritual practices. We suggest virtual reality (VR) as a full-spectrum tool able to capitalize on and catalyze the innately therapeutic aspects of the psychedelic experience, such as detachment from familiar reality, alteration of self-experience, augmentation of sensory perception and induction of mystical-type experiences. This is facilitated by VR's evidenced capacity to: aid relaxation and reduce anxiety; buffer from external stimuli; promote a mindful presence; train the mind to achieve altered states of consciousness (ASC); evoke mystical states; enhance therapeutic alliance and encourage self-efficacy. While these unique VR features appear promising, VR's potential role in PP remains speculative due to lack of empirical evidence on the combined use of VR and PP. Given the increased commercial interest in this synergy there is an urgent need to evaluate this approach. We suggest specific VR models and their role within PP protocols to inspire future direction in scientific research, and provide a list of potential disadvantages, side effects and limitations that need to be carefully considered. These include sensory overstimulation, cyber-sickness, triggering memories of past traumatic events as well as distracting from the inner experience or strongly influencing its contents. A balanced, evidence-based approach may provide continuity across all phases of treatment, support transition into and out of an ASC, deepen acute ASC experiences including mystical states and enrich the psychotherapeutic process of integration. We conclude that the potential application of VR in modulating psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy demands further exploration and an evidence-based approach to both design and implementation.","author":[{"family":"Sekula","given":"Agnieszka D."},{"family":"Downey","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Puspanathan","given":"Prashanth"}],"citation-key":"sekulaVirtualRealityModerator2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.813746","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"813746","PMCID":"PMC8931418","PMID":"35310225","source":"PubMed","title":"Virtual Reality as a Moderator of Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"shakerCapturingPatientsClinicians2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the evidence base supporting the efficacy of video consultations (VCs) in mental health services. Furthermore, the potential of VC treatment was also demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these promising results and conducive conditions for VCs, several studies have highlighted that the uptake and implementation of VCs continues to be slow, even after the pandemic. To facilitate and strengthen the implementation of VCs and exploit their potential as a useful tool for mental health disorder treatment, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the issues and experiences of implementing and using VCs as a treatment modality in clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patients' and clinicians' experiences and attitudes toward using VCs in clinical practice.\nMETHODS: Treatment was conducted through the VC modality. Semistructured interviews were conducted individually with patients (n=10) and focus group interview were conducted with clinicians (n=4). Patients had participated in weekly VC treatment over 2 months as part of mental health outpatient services in Denmark. Data from these interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Thematic analysis of the patient interviews yielded two main themes: (1) adjusting to the practicalities of the VC format and (2) the practice of therapy using VCs. Patients experienced that using VCs was easy and convenient, and it was possible to establish and maintain a therapeutic alliance. They also described the contact as different to in-person therapy. The thematic analysis conducted on clinicians' experiences of using VCs yielded three themes: (1) a shift in mindset from resistance to acceptance, (2) the contact is different when using the VC modality, and (3) adapting to a new way of working. Clinicians experienced that their initial concerns and resistance toward VC implementation gradually diminished over time as they gained clinical experience of using the modality. They expressed that contact with patients can be different when using the VC modality and that it took time to adjust to a new way of working therapeutically.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both patients and clinicians experienced that VCs could enhance access to treatment and be meaningfully integrated into clinical practice. In addition, both groups described the contact when using the VC modality as being different to in-person therapy. Future research could examine patients' and clinicians' perceived differences regarding contact when using the VC modality and the implications for therapeutic interventions.","author":[{"family":"Shaker","given":"Ali Abbas"},{"family":"Simonsen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Tarp","given":"Kristine"},{"family":"Borisov","given":"Radoslav Aleksandrov"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"John Aasted"},{"family":"Bechmann","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Austin","given":"Stephen F."}],"citation-key":"shakerCapturingPatientsClinicians2024","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/50580","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"e50580","PMCID":"PMC11375385","PMID":"39167796","source":"PubMed","title":"Capturing Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences of Using Video Consultations in Mental Health Outpatient Services: Qualitative Thematic Analysis","title-short":"Capturing Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences of Using Video Consultations in Mental Health Outpatient Services","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

Furthermore, the use of telemedicine is expected to expand within the psychiatric field. The efficacy of telemedicine is well described in scientific literature. However, there is a need for a comprehensive quantitative review that analyzes and considers the different clinical outcomes and psychiatric diagnoses.\nOBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to assess whether individual psychiatric outpatient treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders in adults using telemedicine is equivalent to in-person treatment.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of randomized controlled trials was conducted using recognized databases for this review. Overall, 4 outcomes were assessed: treatment efficacy, levels of patient satisfaction, working alliance, and attrition rate. The inverse-variance method was used to summarize the effect size for each outcome.\nRESULTS: A total of 7414 records were identified, and 20 trials were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The trials included posttraumatic stress disorder (9 trials), depressive disorder (6 trials), a mix of different disorders (4 trials), and general anxiety disorder (1 trial). Overall, the analyses yielded evidence that telemedicine is comparable with in-person treatment regarding treatment efficacy (standardized mean difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09; P=.84; I2=19%, 17 trials, n=1814), patient satisfaction mean difference (-0.66, 95% CI -1.60 to 0.28; P=.17; I2=44%, 6 trials, n=591), and attrition rates (risk ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.21; P=.32; I2=0%, 20 trials, n=2804). The results also indicated that the working alliance between telemedicine and in-person modalities was comparable, but the heterogeneity was substantial to considerable (mean difference 0.95, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.38; P=.19; I2=75%, 6 trials, n=539).\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provided new knowledge on individual telemedicine interventions that were considered equivalent to in-person treatment regarding efficacy, patient satisfaction, working alliance, and attrition rates across diagnoses. The certainty of the evidence regarding efficacy was rated as moderate. Furthermore, high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for treatment provided via telemedicine in psychiatry, particularly for personality disorders and a range of anxiety disorders where there is a lack of studies.

Exploring whether therapeutic elements, either unrecognised or perceived as implicit within clinical encounters, are acknowledged and deliberately targeted may improve treatment efficacy. Contextual factors (specifically, patient's and practitioner's beliefs/characteristics; patient-practitioner relationships; the therapeutic setting/environment; and treatment characteristics) could be important, but there is limited evidence regarding their influence. This research aims to review the impact of interventions modifying contextual factors during conservative care on patient's pain and physical functioning.\nDATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: Four electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and AMED) were searched from 2009 until 15th February 2022, using tailored search strategies, and resulted in 3476 unique citations. After initial screening, 170 full-text records were potentially eligible and assessed against the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Thereafter, studies were assessed for methodological quality using a modified Downs and Black scale, data extracted, and synthesised using a narrative approach.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one primary studies (N = 3075 participants), were included in this review. Eight studies reported significant improvements in pain intensity, and seven in physical functioning, in favour of the contextual factor intervention(s). Notable contextual factors included: addressing maladaptive illness beliefs; verbal suggestions to influence symptom change expectations; visual or physical cues to suggest pain-relieving treatment properties; and positive communication such as empathy to enhance the therapeutic alliance.\nCONCLUSION: This review identified influential contextual factors which may augment conservative chronic low back pain care. The heterogeneity of interventions suggests modifying more than one contextual factor may be more impactful on patients' clinical outcomes, although these findings require judicious interpretation.","author":[{"family":"Sherriff","given":"Bronwyn"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Killingback","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Newell","given":"Dave"}],"citation-key":"sherriffImpactContextualFactors2022","container-title":"Chiropractic & Manual Therapies","container-title-short":"Chiropr Man Therap","DOI":"10.1186/s12998-022-00430-8","ISSN":"2045-709X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"20","PMCID":"PMC9028033","PMID":"35449074","source":"PubMed","title":"Impact of contextual factors on patient outcomes following conservative low back pain treatment: systematic review","title-short":"Impact of contextual factors on patient outcomes following conservative low back pain treatment","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Participants completed a novel 4-week mindfulness-based intervention, for 10 to 15 minutes/day, at a minimum of 4 days/week. At 2 weeks, participants completed a credibility and expectancy questionnaire. At 4 weeks, participants completed questionnaires assessing satisfaction, usability and working alliance, as well as a semi-structured phone interview.\nRESULTS: Ten participants completed the study outcomes (7 acute; 3 persisting symptoms). The intervention was perceived as credible (median/max possible = 6.50/9.00 [6.83,8.75]) and DTx was usable (median/max possible = 70.00/100.00 [55.00,82.50]). Participants rated their satisfaction with the DTx (median/max possible = 27.00/32.00 [24.50,29.50]) and the working alliance with the digital mindfulness guides (median/max possible = 3.92/5.00 [3.38-4.33]) as high. Four themes were identified from the qualitative data: (a) positive attributes; (b) negative attributes; (c) ideas for modifications; and (d) technical issues.\nCONCLUSION: Results show modifications to the DTx, instructions and mindfulness intervention, and potential ways to increase adherence by leveraging positive attributes. A randomized control trial will assess the effectiveness of the DTx MBI to decrease the risk of persisting symptoms and reduce the symptom burden following pediatric concussion.","author":[{"family":"Sicard","given":"Veronik"},{"family":"O'Kane","given":"Kiarah"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Butterfield","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Kardish","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Silverberg","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Andra M."},{"family":"Goldfield","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Saab","given":"Bechara J."},{"family":"Gray","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Goulet","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Mackie","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Roth","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Osmond","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Zemek","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Cairncross","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Ledoux","given":"Andrée-Anne"}],"citation-key":"sicardAcceptabilityUsabilityCredibility2024","container-title":"Digital Health","container-title-short":"Digit Health","DOI":"10.1177/20552076241248296","ISSN":"2055-2076","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"20552076241248296","PMCID":"PMC11064757","PMID":"38698825","source":"PubMed","title":"Acceptability, usability, and credibility of a mindfulness-based digital therapeutic for pediatric concussion: A mixed-method study","title-short":"Acceptability, usability, and credibility of a mindfulness-based digital therapeutic for pediatric concussion","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"simonInternetbasedPsychologicalTherapies2021","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To explore in-depth the views on Internet-based psychological therapies and their implementation from the perspective of National Health Service (NHS) commissioners and managers.\nDESIGN: Qualitative interview study.\nMETHOD: Ten NHS commissioners and managers participated in a semi-structured, co-produced interview. Each transcribed interview was double-coded and thematically analysed using The Framework Method.\nRESULTS: Interviews generated three main themes. (1) Capacity issues across psychological therapy services create barriers to face-to-face therapies, and Internet-based interventions offer a solution. (2) Despite reservations, there is growing acceptance of Internet-based therapies. Different ways of connecting with patients are required, and Internet-based treatments are accessible and empowering treatment options, with guided self-help (GSH) preferred. Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered.\nPRACTITIONER POINTS: There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Ploszajski","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Catrin"},{"family":"Smallman","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Neil P."},{"family":"Kitchiner","given":"Neil J."},{"family":"Brookes-Howell","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Bisson","given":"Jonathan I."}],"citation-key":"simonInternetbasedPsychologicalTherapies2021","container-title":"Psychology and Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1111/papt.12341","ISSN":"2044-8341","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"994-1014","PMID":"33788999","source":"PubMed","title":"Internet-based psychological therapies: A qualitative study of National Health Service commissioners and managers views","title-short":"Internet-based psychological therapies","type":"article-journal","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"singlaImplementingPsychologicalInterventions2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Task sharing has been used worldwide to improve access to mental health care, where nonspecialist providers-individuals with no formal training in mental health-have been trained to effectively treat perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Little formative research has been conducted to examine relevant barriers and facilitators of nonspecialist providers and the use of telemedicine in treatment service delivery.\nOBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to examine the main barriers and facilitators of nonspecialist provider-delivered psychological treatments for perinatal populations with common mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, from a multistakeholder perspective.\nMETHODS: This study took place in Toronto, Canada. In total, 33 in-depth interviews were conducted with multiple stakeholder groups (women with lived experience and their significant others, as well as health and mental health professionals). Qualitative data were quantified to estimate commonly endorsed themes within and across stakeholder groups.\nRESULTS: Psychological treatments delivered by nonspecialist providers were considered acceptable by the vast majority of participants (30/33, 90%). Across all stakeholder groups, nurses (20/33, 61%) and midwives (14/33, 42%) were the most commonly endorsed cadre of nonspecialist providers. The majority of stakeholders (32/33, 97%) were amenable to nonspecialist providers delivering psychological treatment via telemedicine (27/33, 82%), although concerns were raised about the ability to establish a therapeutic alliance via telemedicine (16/33, 48%). Empathy was the most desired characteristic of a nonspecialist provider (61%). Patient and patient advocate stakeholders were more likely to emphasize stigma as an important barrier to accessing psychological treatments (7/12, 58%), compared to clinicians (2/9, 22%) and spouses (1/5, 20%). Clinician stakeholders were more likely to emphasize the importance of ensuring nonspecialist providers were trained to deliver psychological treatments (3/9, 33%), compared to other stakeholder groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results can inform the design, implementation, and integration of nonspecialist-delivered interventions via telemedicine for women with perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms in high-income country contexts.","author":[{"family":"Singla","given":"Daisy Radha"},{"family":"Lemberg-Pelly","given":"Sasha"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Zahedi","given":"Nika"},{"family":"Thomas-Jacques","given":"Tyla"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"Cindy-Lee"}],"citation-key":"singlaImplementingPsychologicalInterventions2020","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/19271","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e19271","PMCID":"PMC7484770","PMID":"32852281","source":"PubMed","title":"Implementing Psychological Interventions Through Nonspecialist Providers and Telemedicine in High-Income Countries: Qualitative Study from a Multistakeholder Perspective","title-short":"Implementing Psychological Interventions Through Nonspecialist Providers and Telemedicine in High-Income Countries","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

In addition, clinicians use mHealth apps for continued medical education and clinical decision-making and recommend good-quality apps to patients. However, poor-quality apps can spread misinformation or provide recommendations that are not evidence-based. Therefore, a critical evaluation is needed to assess and recommend good-quality endometriosis mHealth apps.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the quality and provide recommendations for good quality endometriosis mHealth apps for the community and clinicians.\nMETHODS: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines informed the search of mHealth apps on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The search terms included \"endometriosis,\" \"adenomyosis,\" and \"pelvic pain.\" mHealth apps were eligible if they were (1) related to the search terms, (2) were in the English language, and (3) were available free of cost. Only the free content of the eligible mHealth apps was assessed. ENLIGHT, a validated evaluation tool for mobile and web-based interventions, was used to assess the quality across 7 domains such as usability, visual design, user engagement, content, therapeutic persuasiveness, therapeutic alliance, and general subjective evaluation. mHealth apps with a total score of ≥3.5 were classified as \"good\" according to the ENLIGHT scoring system and are recommended as good-quality mHealth apps for endometriosis care.\nRESULTS: In total, 42 mHealth apps were screened, and 19 were included in the quality assessment. A total of 6 good-quality mHealth apps were identified (QENDO, Bearable, Luna for Health, Matilda Health, Branch Health: Pain Management, and CHARLI Health). These apps provided symptom-tracking functions and self-management support. A total of 17 apps were designed for community use, while 2 apps provided a digital endometriosis classification tool to clinicians.

The first search string used the terms \"endometriosis,\" \"adenomyosis,\" or \"pelvic pain,\" whereas \"Australia\" was added to the second search string. Only free eHealth websites in English were included. ENLIGHT, a validated tool, was used to assess the quality across 7 domains such as usability, visual design, user engagement, content, therapeutic persuasiveness, therapeutic alliance, and general subjective evaluation. Websites with a total score of 3.5 or more were classified as \"good\" according to the ENLIGHT scoring system and are recommended as high-quality eHealth websites for information on endometriosis.\nRESULTS: In total, 117 eHealth websites were screened, and 80 were included in the quality assessment. Four high-quality eHealth websites (ie, those that scored 3.5 or more) were identified (Endometriosis Australia Facebook Page, Endometriosis UK, National Action Plan for Endometriosis on EndoActive, and Adenomyosis by the Medical Republic). These websites provided easily understood, engaging, and accurate information. Adenomyosis by the Medical Republic can be used as a resource in clinical practice. Most eHealth websites scored well, 3.5 or more in the domains of usability (n=76, 95%), visual design (n=64, 80%), and content (n=63, 79%).

  {"id":"skoufalosLeveragingDigitalMedicine2021","abstract":"Recent national statistics show that an estimated 11.2 million American adults live with serious, chronic forms of mental illness. The burden of mental illness is considerable for these individuals, their families, and communities. Effective medical treatment for serious mental illness (SMI) requires a patient-centered approach that engages patients in shared decision-making and supports the therapeutic alliance. Information regarding medication-taking behavior is essential for making treatment decisions, particularly in the instance of suboptimal therapeutic response. However, the evidence suggests that the probability of nonconformity with prescribed medication is elevated for individuals with SMI and that clinicians often overestimate their patients' adherence to medication-taking behaviors. In patients with SMI, unidentified problems with adherence may lead to unnecessary changes in treatment regimen and increased rates of hospitalization. Although various approaches have been used to assess medication ingestion with greater accuracy, none are without limitation. The growing field of digital medicine has introduced tools that engage patients for clinical purposes, gather and organize clinical data, and help measure care quality. Physician surveys show an appreciable increase in physician adoption of digital clinical tools, and studies suggest that a significant population of patients with SMI own and are comfortable using digital devices and tools. Digital tools designed to help people with SMI have the potential to transform the support and care available to people with mental health disorders, bridging a technology gap in mental health services.","author":[{"family":"Skoufalos","given":"Alexandria"},{"family":"N'Dri","given":"Laetitia A."},{"family":"Waters","given":"Dexter"}],"citation-key":"skoufalosLeveragingDigitalMedicine2021","container-title":"Population Health Management","container-title-short":"Popul Health Manag","DOI":"10.1089/pop.2021.0083","ISSN":"1942-7905","issue":"S2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"S55-S61","PMID":"34382864","source":"PubMed","title":"Leveraging Digital Medicine to Support Providers and Their Patients in Managing Serious Mental Illness","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"smithImprovingSafetyMedicines2022","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: EHealth holds tremendous promise for enhancing drug safety initiatives known as risk minimization programs. Little is known, however, regarding the scope and quality of existing risk minimization websites.\nMETHODS: Two publicly accessible repositories, REMS@FDA [1] and Electronic Medicines Compendium [2], were reviewed to identify all regulatorily approved risk minimization programs in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) with websites. Website quality was evaluated using the Enlight Quality Assessment tool, a psychometrically validated instrument that addresses seven quality domains.\nRESULTS: Ninety-three websites were identified: 59 for healthcare professionals (7 UK/52 US), and 34 for patients (5 UK/29 US). The websites functioned chiefly as archives for electronic copies of educational materials; a subset (31/93) had additional features. Mean quality ratings for Usability (mean 4.70, SD 0.59), Visual Design (mean 4.03, SD 0.87) and Content (mean 4.31, SD 0.82) were good. General Subjective Evaluation was fair (mean 3.15, SD 1.21).

No differences were found by target audience but several were identified based on region.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk minimization websites are easy to navigate and well organized. Few, however, incorporate eHealth design elements that facilitate user engagement, build therapeutic alliance and exert therapeutic persuasiveness. Such elements can enhance program uptake and effectiveness.

  {"id":"snipesEstablishmentMaintenanceDigital2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based digital therapeutics represent a new treatment modality in mental health, potentially providing cost-efficient, accessible means of augmenting existing treatments for chronic mental illnesses. CT-155/BI 3972080 is a prescription digital therapeutic under development as an adjunct to standard of care treatments for patients 18 years of age and older with experiential negative symptoms (ENS) of schizophrenia. Individual components of CT-155/BI 3972080 are designed based on the underlying principles of face-to-face treatment. A positive therapeutic alliance between patients and health care providers is linked with improved clinical outcomes in mental health. Likewise, establishing a similar therapeutic alliance with a digital therapeutic (ie, digital working alliance [DWA]) may be important for engagement and treatment effectiveness of this modality.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the establishment and maintenance of a DWA between a beta version of CT-155/BI 3972080 (CT-155 beta) and adults with ENS of schizophrenia.\nMETHODS: Two multicenter, exploratory, single-arm studies (study 1: CT-155-C-001 and study 2: CT-155-C-002) enrolled adults with schizophrenia and ENS receiving stable antipsychotic medication (≥12 weeks). Participants had access to CT-155 beta and were presented with daily in-app activities during a 3-week orientation phase that included lessons designed to facilitate building of a DWA. In study 2, the 3-week orientation phase was followed by an abbreviated active 4-week phase. Digital literacy at baseline was evaluated using the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ). The mobile Agnew Relationship Measure (mARM) was used to assess DWA establishment after 3 weeks in both studies, and after 7 weeks in study 2 to assess DWA maintenance. Participant safety, digital literacy, and correlations between negative symptom severity and DWA were assessed in both studies.\nRESULTS: Of the enrolled participants, 94% (46/49) and 86% (43/50) completed studies 1 and 2, respectively. Most were male (study 1: 71%, 35/49; study 2: 80%, 40/50). The baseline digital literacy assessed through MDPQ score was comparable in both studies (study 1: mean 30.56, SD 8.06; study 2: mean 28.69, SD 8.31) indicating proficiency in mobile device use. After 3 weeks, mARM scores (study 1: mean 5.16, SD 0.8; study 2: mean 5.36, SD 1.06) indicated that a positive DWA was established in both studies. In study 2, the positive DWA established at week 3 was maintained at week 7 (mARM: mean 5.48, SD 0.97). There were no adverse events (AEs) in study 1, and 3 nonserious and nontreatment-related AEs in study 2.\nCONCLUSIONS: A positive DWA was established between participants and CT-155 beta within 3 weeks. The second 7-week study showed maintenance of the DWA to the end of the study. Results support the establishment and maintenance of a DWA between adults with ENS of schizophrenia and a beta version of CT-155/BI 3972080, a prescription digital therapeutic under development to target these symptoms.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT05486312; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05486312.","author":[{"family":"Snipes","given":"Cassandra"},{"family":"Dorner-Ciossek","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Hare","given":"Brendan D."},{"family":"Besedina","given":"Olya"},{"family":"Campellone","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Petrova","given":"Mariya"},{"family":"Lakhan","given":"Shaheen E."},{"family":"Pratap","given":"Abhishek"}],"citation-key":"snipesEstablishmentMaintenanceDigital2025","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/64959","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e64959","PMCID":"PMC11811661","PMID":"39869902","source":"PubMed","title":"Establishment and Maintenance of a Digital Therapeutic Alliance in People Living With Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia: Two Exploratory Single-Arm Studies","title-short":"Establishment and Maintenance of a Digital Therapeutic Alliance in People Living With Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"solnessRelationshipFactorsInternetDelivered2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered psychological interventions (IPIs) have been shown to be effective for a variety of psychological concerns, including postpartum depression. Human-supported programs produce better adherence and larger effect sizes than unsupported programs; however, what it is about support that affects outcomes is not well understood. Therapeutic alliance is one possibility that has been found to contribute to outcomes; however, the specific mechanism is not well understood. Participant perspectives and qualitative methodology are nearly absent from the IPI alliance research and may help provide new directions.\nOBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to provide participant perspectives on engagement with an IPI for postpartum depression to help inform alliance research, development of new IPIs, and inform resource allocation.\nMETHODS: A qualitative methodology was used to explore participant perspectives of veteran women's engagement with the MomMoodBooster program, a human-supported internet-delivered intervention for postpartum depression. Participants were asked 4 open-ended questions with the 3-month postintervention survey, \"In what ways did you find the MomMoodBooster most helpful?\" \"How do you think the MomMoodBooster could have been improved?\" \"In what ways did you find the personal coach calls to be helpful?\" and \"How do you think the personal coach calls could have been improved?\"\nRESULTS: Data were collected from 184 participants who responded to at least 1 of the open-ended questions. These were analyzed using thematic analysis and a process of reaching a consensus among coders. The results suggest that not only the engagement with the support person is perceived as a significant contributor to participant experiences while using the MomMoodBooster content but also the relationship factors are particularly meaningful. The results provide insights into the specific qualities of the support person that were perceived as most impactful, such as warmth, empathy and genuineness, and feeling normalized and supported. In addition, the results provide insight into the specific change processes that can be targeted through support interactions, such as encouraging self-reflection and self-care and challenging negative thinking.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize the importance of relationship factors between support persons and an IPI program for postpartum depression. The findings suggest that focusing on specific aspects of the alliance and the therapeutic relationship could yield fruitful directions for the training of support personnel and for future alliance-based research of internet-delivered treatments.","author":[{"family":"Solness","given":"Cara L."},{"family":"Holdefer","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Ti"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Emily B.

To improve the suicide assessment process, psychologists and other mental health providers should emphasize respect and empathy, show cultural humility, and seek to establish trust before expecting openness and honesty from youth of color. Additionally, the fact that suicide assessment with youth who identify as White is also generally unhelpful, makes emphasizing relationship and development of a working alliance with all youth even more important.

Digital twins (DTs) promise to revolutionize the field of mental health, as they are doing in other fields of science, including oncology and cardiology, where they have been successfully deployed. The use of DTs in mental health is yet to be explored. In this Perspective, we lay the conceptual foundations for mental health DTs (MHDT). An MHDT is a virtual representation of an individual's mental states and processes. It is continually updated from data collected over the lifespan of the individual, and guides mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating patients based on mechanistic models and statistical and machine learning tools. The merits of MHDT are demonstrated through the example of the working alliance between the therapist and the patient, which is one of the most consistent mechanisms predicting treatment outcome.","author":[{"family":"Spitzer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dattner","given":"Itai"},{"family":"Zilcha-Mano","given":"Sigal"}],"citation-key":"spitzerDigitalTwinsFuture2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1082598","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1082598","PMCID":"PMC10040602","PMID":"36993921","source":"PubMed","title":"Digital twins and the future of precision mental health","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"stefanaEffectivenessNovelWebBased2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Routine process and outcome monitoring interventions added to psychotherapy are known to improve treatment outcomes, although they vary in format and effectiveness.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether a therapist-independent, internet-based routine process monitoring and feedback system could significantly reduce psychological distress and enhance the quality of the therapeutic relationship compared with a treatment-as-usual control group among individuals already engaged in individual psychotherapy.\nMETHODS: We randomized 475 participants into either the intervention group, which received access to an internet-based routine process monitoring and feedback system in addition to psychotherapy, or the control group, which received only psychotherapy. The trial lasted for 10 weeks. Follow-up assessments at 5 weeks and 10 weeks used the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure as the primary outcome, with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised and the Real Relationship Inventory-Client form as secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS: Per-protocol analyses (n=166) showed that psychological distress decreased in both groups, but there was no significant advantage for the intervention group. The intervention group experienced a decline in the genuineness dimension score of the real relationship, with an effect size of d=-0.27, compared with d=0.01 in the control group. In the intervention group (but not in the control group), dropouts showed significantly lower real relationship levels (P=.002), working alliance quality (P=.051), and emotional disclosure (P=.01) compared with those who completed the study. Additionally, logistic regression revealed distinct predictors of dropout within the control group and intervention group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings do not provide conclusive evidence for the efficacy of the new internet-based intervention in enhancing self-monitoring and prompting reflection on patients' emotional responses to their therapists. However, the intervention appears to influence patients' perceptions of the genuineness dimension in the therapeutic relationship, warranting further investigation. We hypothesize that this alteration in the genuineness dimension could be attributed to the intervention facilitating a more realistic and accurate perception of the therapeutic relationship among participants.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06038747; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06038747.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/55369.","author":[{"family":"Stefana","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Fusar-Poli","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Vieta","given":"Eduard"},{"family":"Youngstrom","given":"Eric A."}],"citation-key":"stefanaEffectivenessNovelWebBased2024","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/63234","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"e63234","PMCID":"PMC11635334","PMID":"39602203","source":"PubMed","title":"Effectiveness of a Novel Web-Based Intervention to Enhance Therapeutic Relationships and Treatment Outcomes in Adult Individual Psychotherapy: Randomized Controlled Trial and Analysis of Predictors of Dropouts","title-short":"Effectiveness of a Novel Web-Based Intervention to Enhance Therapeutic Relationships and Treatment Outcomes in Adult Individual Psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"sternRedefiningRelationshipDigital2025","abstract":"Digital therapeutic programs are emerging almost daily, offering the potential to reduce healthcare access inequalities by providing more flexible and accessible care options. However, as with traditional healthcare, the issue of patient engagement is fundamental, and the latest research have reported that fewer than 30% of users complete these programs in their entirety. Hence, many authors emphasize the importance of studying the role of therapeutic alliances specifically adapted to digital care. The therapeutic alliance encompasses the collaborative aspects of the relationship between the therapist and the patient. In this context there is a need to reconceptualize the alliance within the context of digital healthcare as it can enhance engagement, adherence, and the effectiveness of such treatments. The objective of this qualitative study was to identify the components of the digital therapeutic alliance. A thematic analysis has identified three major themes that appear to constitute the digital therapeutic alliance among 44 users of an online program: trust in the program, perception of interactions, and feeling of consideration. These results prompted a discussion of the challenges of digital healthcare, including the terminology to use. The term \"digital therapeutic adherence\" is proposed, thereby opening up a field for research and clarification of this important concept distinct from traditional alliance.","author":[{"family":"Stern","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Breton","given":"Zélia"},{"family":"Alexaline","given":"Maïa"},{"family":"Geoffroy","given":"Pierre A."},{"family":"Bungener","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"sternRedefiningRelationshipDigital2025","container-title":"L'Encephale","container-title-short":"Encephale","DOI":"10.1016/j.encep.2024.02.011","ISSN":"0013-7006","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"227-232","PMID":"38724431","source":"PubMed","title":"Redefining the relationship in digital care: A qualitative study of the Digital Therapeutic Alliance","title-short":"Redefining the relationship in digital care","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

A series of multi-level models evaluated change in outcomes by mid- and post-treatment assessments (relative to baseline) as a function of the overall alliance. Quasi-Poisson models evaluated the effect of the overall alliance on aggregated counts of platform usage. Exploratory analyses repeated these models in terms of the bond (human-human) or the task/goal (human-program) alliance.\nRESULTS: Stronger overall alliance at mid-treatment predicted lower loneliness at mid-treatment and lower social anxiety at mid- and post-treatment. It was also associated with higher completion of therapy activities and authoring of comments and reactions. A strong bond with an online therapist was associated with lower loneliness and higher perceived social support at mid-treatment, lower social anxiety at post-treatment as well as a higher number of reactions made on the social network. Stronger alliance with the platform's tasks and goals facilitated lower social anxiety at both follow-up assessments and was further associated with higher completion of therapy activities and reactions in the social network.\nCONCLUSIONS: The alliance may impact aspects of social recovery and usage in digital interventions for FEP.

Through the prism of the attachment theory, this phenomenon can be understood as a manifestation of the patient's insecure attachment style, needing a highly-responsive care delivery. We developed an electronic health mobile application, co-designed with patients, aimed at helping healthcare teams respond to their patients' needs, and fostering adherence to care. This acceptability study evaluated patients everyday use of the application for eight weeks, assessing their satisfaction with the system, and its integration within professionals' current practice in our center.\nMETHODS: This single-center, prospective study was conducted between January 2022 and December 2022. 24 adult patients with any type of addiction were included. They were granted access to the application for eight weeks, and were invited to complete the System Usability Scale questionnaire regarding their satisfaction with application's usability at the end of the study. The application uses active self-reports, which are later discussed with the healthcare team, and foster both the working alliance and the decision-making process.\nRESULTS: 17 patients out of 24 reached the primary endpoint. On average, over the eight-weeks period, patients logged in the application 38.2 times, and sent 5.9 messages to the healthcare team. Interestingly, 64.3% of the user logins were recorded outside of our center's working hours (either from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., or during week-ends and bank holidays), and 70.8% of the patients logged into the application at least one time between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. 18 patients completed the System Usability Scale questionnaire, which averaged a score of 81.8 out of 100. Healthcare professionals logged in the application's messaging system 4.5 times a day on average.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows promising results, as patients engaged well with various components of the application. It was moreover possible for healthcare workers in our center to integrate this tool in their daily activities. More work is needed to better understand the various patients' needs regarding the application, further strengthen their adherence to the intervention, and understand professionals' motivations to use the application.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04659954.

Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis to generate themes.\nRESULTS: Six salient themes were identified. Facilitators included the therapist-assisted nature of the program; the ease of registration and the lack of cost; and the feasibility of completing the psychoeducational modules given the online and self-paced nature of the program. Barriers included challenges with the online remote modality for developing the therapeutic alliance; the program's generalized nature, which limited customization to individual needs; and a lack of formal integration between the iCBT program and the health care system.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the program was generally well-received by patients and therapists due to its accessibility and feasibility, the digital format of the program presented both benefits and unique challenges. Strategies for improving the quality of service delivery include opportunities for synchronous communication between therapists and patients, options for increased customization, and the formal integration of iCBT into a broader stepped-care model that centralizes patient referrals between care providers and promotes continuity of care.","author":[{"family":"Thapar","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Bilal Noreen"},{"family":"Fanaieyan","given":"Roz"},{"family":"Kishimoto","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Bolea-Alamañac","given":"Blanca"},{"family":"Leon-Carlyle","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"O'Riordan","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Keresteci","given":"Maggie"},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Onil"}],"citation-key":"thaparPatientTherapistPerceptions2024","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/50113","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"language":"eng","page":"e50113","PMCID":"PMC10912991","PMID":"38373027","source":"PubMed","title":"Patient and Therapist Perceptions of a Publicly Funded Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) Program for Ontario Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Study","title-short":"Patient and Therapist Perceptions of a Publicly Funded Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) Program for Ontario Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"thibaudeauNavigatingSocialCognitive2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Social cognitive impairments are prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and have detrimental effects on functioning. Cognitive remediation (CR) has shown its efficacy in improving social cognitive impairments, although the transfer of these skills to daily life and the personalization of these interventions remain challenging. RC2S (Remédiation Cognitive de la Cognition Sociale dans la Schizophrénie; Cognitive remediation of social cognition in Schizophrenia) is a French CR that combines the learning of strategies and practice using paper-and-pencil exercises and digital relational simulations. This French program was designed as an in-person intervention.\nOBJECTIVE: This project aims to culturally adapt the RC2S program, in French-Canadian and North American English and to assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and implementation of a remote version in people with SSD. An exploratory objective is to assess the preliminary effect of remote RC2S on goal attainment, social cognition, and psychosocial outcomes.\nMETHODS: We will use a pre-post quasi-experimental design. First, the translation and cultural adaptation in North American English and French-Canadian of RC2S is presented. Then, 20 participants aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of SSD, presenting with a subjective or an objective impairment in social cognition, will be included to receive RC2S. In addition, 5 therapists will be included as research participants to assess their perspective on RC2S. Participants with SSD will undergo a baseline remote assessment of their social cognition, clinical symptoms, and functioning. They will then start remote RC2S for 24 biweekly individual 1-hour sessions with a therapist. Following the case formulation and goal setting, participants will complete personalized paper-and-pencil exercises to develop strategies and integrative digital relational simulations, during which they will help an avatar navigate through a variety of social contexts and relationships. The last 2 sessions are dedicated to the transfer to daily life. All participants will complete in-session questionnaires assessing therapeutic alliance, motivation, acceptability, feasibility, and implementation. Following RC2S, the participants with SSD will repeat the same assessment as the baseline. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data about acceptability, feasibility, safety, and implementation. To assess the preliminary effect of RC2S, an intention-to-treat approach will be used with linear mixed models for repeated measures with fixed effects of time.\nRESULTS: So far, 45% (9/20) of participants with SSD (mean age 37.9, SD 9.3 years) have completed the project. They received a mean of 20.5 out of 24 (SD 3.5) sessions of RC2S. A total of 5 therapists also completed the project.\nCONCLUSIONS: Improving social cognitive impairments is an important target in SSD to promote functional recovery.

However, to qualify as a preventive workplace intervention, more research is needed to evaluate whether BHC can further elevate well-being among moderately mentally healthy employees.\nOBJECTIVE: Using real-world data, this study evaluates the preliminary effectiveness of app-based BHC against a nonrandomized control group with open access to self-help tools in improving well-being (ie, mood levels and perceived stress). The study also explores the active ingredients of BHC and dose-response associations between the number of BHC sessions and well-being improvements.\nMETHODS: Employees residing across Asia-Pacific countries (N=1025; mean age 30.85, SD 6.97 y) who reported moderately positive mood and medium levels of perceived stress in their first week of using the mental health app Intellect were included in this study. Users who were given access by their organizations to Intellect's BHC services were assigned to the \"Coaching\" condition (512/1025, 49.95%; mean age 31.09, SD 6.87 y), whereas other employees remained as \"Control\" participants (513/1025, 50.05%; mean age 30.61, SD 7.06 y). To evaluate effectiveness, monthly scores from the validated mood and stress sliders were aggregated into a composite well-being score and further examined using repeated-measure conditional growth models. Postcoaching items on \"Perceived Usefulness of the BHC session\" and \"Working Alliance with my Coach\" were examined as active ingredients of BHC using 1-1-1 multilevel mediation models. Finally, 2-way repeated-measure mixed ANOVA models were conducted to examine dose-response effects on well-being improvements between groups (coaching and control) across time.\nRESULTS: Growth curve analyses revealed significant time by group interaction effects for composite well-being, where \"Coaching\" users reported significantly greater improvements in well-being than \"Control\" participants across time (composite well-being: F1,391=6.12; ηp2=0.02; P=.01). Among \"Coaching\" participants, dependent-sample 2-tailed t tests revealed significant improvements in composite well-being from baseline to 11 months (t512=1.98; Cohen d=0.17; P=.049).

  {"id":"tongConceptualizingDigitalTherapeutic2023","abstract":"Fully automated mental health apps provide a promising opportunity for increasing access to mental health care and resources. Given this opportunity, continued research into the utility and effectiveness of mental health apps is crucial. Therapeutic alliance (TA) refers to the relationship between a client and a healthcare professional, and has been shown to be an important predictor of clinical outcomes in face-to-face therapy. Given the significance of TA in traditional therapy, it is important to explore whether the notion of a digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) in the context of fully automated mental health apps also plays an important role in clinical outcomes. Current evidence shows that the conceptualization of DTA in the context of fully automated mental health apps can be potentially different to TA in face-to-face therapy. Thus, a new DTA conceptual model is necessary for comprehensively understanding the mechanisms underpinning DTA for fully automated mental health apps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that qualitatively explored the dimensions of a DTA in the context of fully automated mental health apps. We conducted interviews with 20 users of mental health apps to explore the key dimensions comprising DTA in the context of fully automated mental health apps. We found that although conceptualizations of DTA and TA have shared dimensions, flexibility and emotional experiences are unique domains in DTA. On the other hand, although agreement on goals between a therapist and a client is important in face to face therapy, we found that users can have an alliance with an app without a goal. The importance of goal needs further investigations.","author":[{"family":"Tong","given":"Fangziyun"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Reeva"},{"family":"D'Alfonso","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Bucci","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"tongConceptualizingDigitalTherapeutic2023","container-title":"Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Clin Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1002/cpp.2851","ISSN":"1099-0879","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"998-1012","PMID":"37042076","source":"PubMed","title":"Conceptualizing the digital therapeutic alliance in the context of fully automated mental health apps: A thematic analysis","title-short":"Conceptualizing the digital therapeutic alliance in the context of fully automated mental health apps","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"tongDigitalTherapeuticAlliance2022","abstract":"Fully automated mental health smartphone apps show strong promise in increasing access to psychological support. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how to make these apps effective. The therapeutic alliance (TA), or the relationship between healthcare professionals and clients, is considered fundamental to successful treatment outcomes in face-to-face therapy. Thus, understanding the TA in the context of fully automated apps would bring us insights into building effective smartphone apps which engage users. However, the concept of a digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) in the context of fully automated mental health smartphone apps is nascent and under-researched, and only a handful of studies have been published in this area. In particular, no published review paper examined the DTA in the context of fully automated apps. The objective of this review was to integrate the extant literature to identify research gaps and future directions in the investigation of DTA in relation to fully automated mental health smartphone apps. Our findings suggest that the DTA in relation to fully automated smartphone apps needs to be conceptualized differently to traditional face-to-face TA. First, the role of bond in the context of fully automated apps is unclear. Second, human components of face-to-face TA, such as empathy, are hard to achieve in the digital context. Third, some users may perceive apps as more non-judgmental and flexible, which may further influence DTA formation. Subdisciplines of computer science, such as affective computing and positive computing, and some human-computer interaction (HCI) theories, such as those of persuasive technology and human-app attachment, can potentially help to foster a sense of empathy, build tasks and goals and develop bond or an attachment between users and apps, which may further contribute to DTA formation in fully automated smartphone apps. Whilst the review produced a relatively limited quantity of literature, this reflects the novelty of the topic and the need for further research.","author":[{"family":"Tong","given":"Fangziyun"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Reeva"},{"family":"D'Alfonso","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Bucci","given":"Sandra"}],"citation-key":"tongDigitalTherapeuticAlliance2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.819623","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"819623","PMCID":"PMC9256980","PMID":"35815030","source":"PubMed","title":"Digital Therapeutic Alliance With Fully Automated Mental Health Smartphone Apps: A Narrative Review","title-short":"Digital Therapeutic Alliance With Fully Automated Mental Health Smartphone Apps","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"topitzerHowDifferingAudiences2022","abstract":"In the last five years there has been an explosion of mobile apps that aim to impact emotional well-being, yet limited research has examined the ways that users interact, and specifically write to develop a therapeutic alliance within these apps. Writing is a developmental practice in which a narrator transforms amorphous thoughts and emotions into expressions, and according to narrative theory, the linguistic characteristics of writing can be understood as a physical manifestation of a narrator's affect. Informed by literacy theorists who have argued convincingly that narrators address different audiences in different ways, we used IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing software (IBM Watson NLP) to examine how users' expression of emotion on a well-being app differed depending on the audience. Our findings demonstrate that audience was strongly associated with the way users' expressed emotions in writing. When writing to an explicit audience users wrote longer narratives, with less sadness, less anger, less disgust, less fear and more joy. These findings have direct relevance for researchers and well-being app design.","author":[{"family":"Topitzer","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Yueming"},{"family":"Kasumba","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Kreniske","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"topitzerHowDifferingAudiences2022","container-title":"Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies","container-title-short":"Hum Behav Emerg Technol","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4453980","ISSN":"2578-1863","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"4453980","PMCID":"PMC10686580","PMID":"38031588","source":"PubMed","title":"How Differing Audiences Were Associated with User Emotional Expression on a Well-Being App","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},
  {"id":"tremainTherapeuticAllianceDigital2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions offer unique advantages, and research indicates that these interventions are effective for a range of mental health concerns. Although these interventions are less established for individuals with serious mental illnesses, they demonstrate significant promise. A central consideration in traditional face-to-face therapies is the therapeutic alliance, whereas the nature of a digital therapeutic alliance and its relationship with outcomes requires further attention, particularly for individuals with serious mental illnesses.\nOBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to encourage further consideration and critical evaluation of the therapeutic alliance in digital mental health, specifically for individuals with serious mental illnesses.\nMETHODS: A narrative review was conducted by combining 3 main areas of the literature: the first examining the evidence for digital mental health interventions for serious mental illnesses, the second illuminating the nature and role of the therapeutic alliance in digital interventions, and the third surrounding practical considerations to enhance a digital therapeutic alliance.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that a therapeutic alliance can be cultivated in digital interventions for those with serious mental illnesses, but that it may have unique, yet-to-be-confirmed characteristics in digital contexts. In addition, a therapeutic alliance appears to be less directly associated with outcomes in digital interventions than with those in face-to-face therapies. One possibility is that the digital therapeutic alliance is associated with increased engagement and adherence to digital interventions, through which it appears to influence outcomes. A number of design and implementation considerations may enhance the digital therapeutic alliance, including human support and technological features.\nCONCLUSIONS: More research is required to further understand the nature and specific role of a therapeutic alliance in digital interventions for serious mental illnesses, particularly in informing their design. This review revealed several key research priorities to advance the therapeutic alliance in digital interventions.","author":[{"family":"Tremain","given":"Hailey"},{"family":"McEnery","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"tremainTherapeuticAllianceDigital2020","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/17204","ISSN":"2368-7959","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"e17204","PMCID":"PMC7442952","PMID":"32763881","source":"PubMed","title":"The Therapeutic Alliance in Digital Mental Health Interventions for Serious Mental Illnesses: Narrative Review","title-short":"The Therapeutic Alliance in Digital Mental Health Interventions for Serious Mental Illnesses","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"trimbleHybridVirtualGroup2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) group therapy has traditionally been conducted in-person; however, there is growing interest in virtual formats. While virtual group therapy can address certain barriers for in-person attendance, it may compromise key elements like therapeutic alliance and group cohesiveness. A model that integrates both in-person and virtual participants may help balance the benefits of these two approaches.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify and define approaches to SUD group therapy that integrate in-person and virtual participants, summarize study outcomes associated with these models, propose standardized terminology, and provide preliminary recommendations for their application in SUD treatment.\nDESIGN: A comprehensive search was conducted on 11/13/2024 and updated on 12/16/2024 by a medical librarian. Included articles were published 2000 onwards and conducted with SUD group therapy where participants or group facilitators were both in-person and virtual. We extracted data from 4 articles that met the search criteria.\nRESULTS: A total of 1353 articles were screened, 20 were evaluated at the full-text level, and 4 met study inclusion criteria. Two \"hybrid\" model designs for SUD were identified. One model utilized a virtual group facilitator, while participants remained together in-person. The second model kept the facilitator in-person and allowed group participants to be present either virtually or in-person within the same group. Outcomes evaluated included treatment completion across groups and patient perceived changes in therapeutic alliance, group cohesion, and understanding of addiction.\nCONCLUSION: We propose a consensus definition of hybrid virtual group models where at least one group member, either the facilitator or one of the participants, attends groups in-person while at least one member attends virtually. While research is limited, early findings suggest that hybrid SUD groups have similar outcomes to in-person groups and better outcomes than virtual-only groups. Unique considerations should be made to ensure that hybrid SUD models are implemented appropriately and effectively.","author":[{"family":"Trimble","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Bormann","given":"Nicholas L."},{"family":"Kalata","given":"Alyssa H."},{"family":"Gerberi","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Oesterle","given":"Tyler S."}],"citation-key":"trimbleHybridVirtualGroup2025","container-title":"Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation","container-title-short":"Subst Abuse Rehabil","DOI":"10.2147/SAR.S518266","ISSN":"1179-8467","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"eng","page":"137-146","PMCID":"PMC12086859","PMID":"40390798","source":"PubMed","title":"Hybrid Virtual Group Model for Substance Use Disorder Therapy: A Scoping Review","title-short":"Hybrid Virtual Group Model for Substance Use Disorder Therapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"unsgaard-tondelBuildingTherapeuticAlliances2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low back pain is a multidimensional disorder and a biopsychosocial management approach is recommended. However, recent data indicates that physiotherapists mainly focus on biomechanical aspects in treatment and struggle with addressing psychosocial barriers for recovery. We wanted to explore how physiotherapists express their experiences of building therapeutic alliances within a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain.\nMETHODS: Qualitative focus-group interviews were performed with five physiotherapists on two occasions with 6 months in between. Data were analyzed within a hermeneutical perspective with decontextualization and recontextualization, and identification of themes.\nRESULTS: Four main themes were identified from the analyses: (1) An ideal standard: Presence, empathy and applying the biopsychosocial perspective is central for building therapeutic alliance. (2) Time-consuming: Active listening and personally adapted treatment is important and time-consuming. (3) Challenging area: Advanced clinical reasoning is needed to understand and modify complex barriers for recovery. Clinical experience is sometimes necessary to integrate the psychological and social domains into physiotherapy management. (4) The art of balancing: Important to apply sensitive communication to help patients gain new insight. Some heavy psychosocial demands on patients may be outside physiotherapists' professional competence.\nDISCUSSION: The physiotherapists in this focus group study expressed a shared view that therapeutic alliance should build upon person-centering, motivational communication, and facilitation of lifestyle adjustments within a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain. Complex clinical reasoning necessary as the optimal cause-corrective treatment strategies were often not obvious. Time and tools to uncover and modify relevant psychological obstacles for recovery were perceived challenging and partly dependent on clinical experience. Addressment of psychosocial obstacles for recovery should be included in basic as well as postgraduate curriculums for physiotherapists. Collaborative practice support strategies like peer guidance and better platforms for interprofessional collaboration and decision support could contribute to improve practice in the psychosocial domain.","author":[{"family":"Unsgaard-Tøndel","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Søderstrøm","given":"Sylvia"}],"citation-key":"unsgaard-tondelBuildingTherapeuticAlliances2022","container-title":"Physiotherapy Research International: The Journal for Researchers and Clinicians in Physical Therapy","container-title-short":"Physiother Res Int","DOI":"10.1002/pri.1932","ISSN":"1471-2865","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"e1932","PMID":"34739185","source":"PubMed","title":"Building therapeutic alliances with patients in treatment for low back pain: A focus group study","title-short":"Building therapeutic alliances with patients in treatment for low back pain","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"valdezLetMeSpell2022","abstract":"Rachel is a 10-year-old White girl with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and a history of trauma who presented for evaluation by Dr. Narayanaswamy, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician. A pediatric resident observed the visit with permission from Rachel's parents.During the visit, Dr. Narayanaswamy spoke to Rachel's case manager over the phone to advocate for a trauma-based day treatment program at her school. At the end of the call, the case manager asked the physician for her full name. Dr. Narayanaswamy responded with her name and asked the case manager, \"Would you like me to spell it?\" At that time, Rachel's father began to laugh, shook his head, and incredulously remarked, \"Ugh, yeah you need to spell it.\" Dr. Narayanaswamy ignored the comment and completed the phone call.After the visit, Dr. Narayanaswamy explained to the resident that the father's derisive laughter was a microaggression. The resident appreciated the observation and, after a pause, asked why she chose not to defend herself when the microaggression occurred. Dr. Narayanaswamy reflected that she had refrained from responding to Rachel's father over concern that he would retaliate by providing low ratings on the postvisit patient satisfaction survey sent to all patients who received care at the institution. The granular survey results, comprising ratings in each survey subheading category for each clinician, are made public to members of her division each quarter, and low ratings are scrutinized by the leadership. Dr. Narayanaswamy thought it unfortunate that she felt inhibited in her response because this deprived the resident of observing ways to address microaggressions during an encounter, deprived herself the opportunity to respond directly to Rachel's father, and deprived Rachel from an instructive moment about racial empathy.Dr. Narayanaswamy wrote a letter about the incident to the chief of clinical affairs to inquire what recourse clinicians had in these situations and whether certain patient encounters could be flagged to prevent the postvisit patient survey from being automatically sent. The chief responded that the incident was unfortunate and praised Dr. Narayanaswamy's restraint and professionalism but denied her request to have postvisit surveys blocked for certain encounters. He shared that if a clinician were to be dissatisfied with a visit satisfaction rating, the clinician could petition for a review, and a committee would subsequently determine whether the review could be removed.How can health care professionals respond to microaggressions while maintaining a therapeutic alliance with the patient/family members and how can institutions support health care professionals in this endeavor?","author":[{"family":"Valdez","given":"Purnima"},{"family":"Kendrick-Allwood","given":"Salathiel"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Traci S."},{"family":"Spinks-Franklin","given":"Adiaha"},{"family":"Nyp","given":"Sarah S."}],"citation-key":"valdezLetMeSpell2022","container-title":"Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics: JDBP","container-title-short":"J Dev Behav Pediatr","DOI":"10.1097/DBP.0000000000001082","ISSN":"1536-7312","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6],["1",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"303-306","PMID":"35442924","source":"PubMed","title":"Let Me Spell It Out: The Impact of Microaggression on the Health Care Professional","title-short":"Let Me Spell It Out","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"valentineRecommenderSystemsMental2022","abstract":"Recommender systems assist users in receiving preferred or relevant services and information. Using such technology could be instrumental in addressing the lack of relevance digital mental health apps have to the user, a leading cause of low engagement. However, the use of recommender systems for digital mental health apps, particularly those driven by personal data and artificial intelligence, presents a range of ethical considerations. This paper focuses on considerations particular to the juncture of recommender systems and digital mental health technologies. While separate bodies of work have focused on these two areas, to our knowledge, the intersection presented in this paper has not yet been examined. This paper identifies and discusses a set of advantages and ethical concerns related to incorporating recommender systems into the digital mental health (DMH) ecosystem. Advantages of incorporating recommender systems into DMH apps are identified as (1) a reduction in choice overload, (2) improvement to the digital therapeutic alliance, and (3) increased access to personal data & self-management. Ethical challenges identified are (1) lack of explainability, (2) complexities pertaining to the privacy/personalization trade-off and recommendation quality, and (3) the control of app usage history data. These novel considerations will provide a greater understanding of how DMH apps can effectively and ethically implement recommender systems.","author":[{"family":"Valentine","given":"Lee"},{"family":"D'Alfonso","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Reeva"}],"citation-key":"valentineRecommenderSystemsMental2022","container-title":"AI & society","container-title-short":"AI Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-021-01322-w","ISSN":"0951-5666","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,17]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-12","PMCID":"PMC8761504","PMID":"35068708","source":"PubMed","title":"Recommender systems for mental health apps: advantages and ethical challenges","title-short":"Recommender systems for mental health apps","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"vanbenthemDyadicApproachAssessing2025","abstract":"When studying therapeutic alliance, researchers typically use data with a 'one-with-many' (OWM) nested structure in which each therapist ('one') treats several clients ('many'). The OWM structure offers the opportunity to assess the interdependence in dyadic therapeutic alliance data by disentangling three components: (1) the client's tendency to generally rate the alliance with his therapists ('client perceiver' component); (2) the client's rating of the unique alliance with his therapist ('client relationship' component); and (3) the therapist's characteristics that elicit a consistent alliance rating in his clients ('therapist partner' component). Similarly, three such components can be distinguished for the therapists' alliance ratings. We used the reciprocal OWM design to distinguish these alliance components, pertaining to the first therapeutic session of two hundred and three youths aged 13 to 23 years who entered a youth mental health and youth addiction treatment facility. We found that most of the alliance variance pertained to the relationship component (client-rated alliance: 99.2%; therapist-rated alliance: 56.0%), with virtually no evidence of therapist's characteristics that elicited a consistent (high or low) alliance rating in his clients. Clients who reported a uniquely strong alliance with their therapist were more likely to have a favorable 4-months treatment outcome (Odds ratio 1.10; p < 0.001). None of the other (client/therapist) alliance components were related to treatment outcome, nor did we find evidence of dyadic reciprocity, which would occur when a therapist would report a particularly strong alliance with the client if that client reported a particularly strong alliance with the therapist, and vice versa.","author":[{"family":"Benthem","given":"Patty","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Spijkerman","given":"Renske"},{"family":"Blanken","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Vermeiren","given":"Robert R.

We studied the frequency and nature of empathic opportunities and physician responses in patients visiting a hand surgeon. We also sought patient characteristics associated with the number of patient-initiated-clues and missed opportunities by surgeons. Methods: For this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 83 new, adult patients visiting 1 of 3 hand surgeons during a period of 4 months. All visits were audio-recorded, and empathic opportunities (patient-initiated emotional or social clues) and physician responses were categorized using the model of Levenson et al. Before the visit, patients completed the Newest Vital Sign health literacy test; 3 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-based questionnaires: Upper-Extremity function, Pain Interference, and Depression questionnaires; and a sociodemographic survey. Results: Empathic opportunities were present in 70% of hand surgery office visits. Surgeons responded empathically to about half of the opportunities. Patients with limited health literacy and greater symptoms of depression (small correlation; r = -0.29) were less likely to receive a positive response. Response to an empathic opportunity did not affect visit duration. Conclusions: Hand surgeons often miss empathic opportunities.

  {"id":"vanlotringenResponsibleRelationsSystematic2021","abstract":"Introduction: Developing a good therapeutic alliance is considered essential for the responsible delivery of psychotherapy. Text-based digital psychotherapy has become increasingly common, yet much remains unclear about the alliance and its importance for delivering mental health care via a digital format. To employ text-based digital therapies responsibly, more insight is needed into the type and strength of the therapeutic alliance online. Methods: A systematic scoping review was performed searching four databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library. A total of 23 studies were selected and data was extracted and tabulated to explore the characteristics of studies on text-based psychotherapy, measurements of the therapeutic alliance and associations of the alliance with treatment outcome. Results: The therapeutic alliance in text-based digital interventions was studied with a variety of client groups, though mostly for clients diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression issues. Treatment modalities were predominantly internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and tailored platforms for distinct client groups (e.g., PTSD). Almost all treatments used asynchronous text-based communication, such as e-mails and integrated messaging functions, which were mainly used to give feedback on tasks. For measurements, a version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) was used in most studies. Measurements with the WAI or WAI- short form indicated a good therapeutic alliance with a weighted mean score of 5.66 (on a scale of 1 to 7) and a weighted standard deviation of 0.84. Relations between the therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes were mostly positive, with many studies reporting significant associations (n = 8 out of 10) or significant effects of the therapeutic alliance on treatment outcomes (n = 5 out of 6). Discussion: Our scoping review suggests that a good therapeutic alliance can be established in digital psychotherapy through text-based communication, and shows support for a positive relationship between the alliance and treatment outcomes. These findings illustrate that text-based online psychotherapy can be a responsible treatment option as far as the establishment of the therapeutic alliance is concerned. However, current measures of the therapeutic alliance might miss important aspects of the alliance in digital treatment, such as the presence of empathy or compassion.","author":[{"family":"Lotringen","given":"Charlotte M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Jeken","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Westerhof","given":"Gerben J."},{"family":"Ten Klooster","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Kelders","given":"Saskia M."},{"family":"Noordzij","given":"Matthijs L."}],"citation-key":"vanlotringenResponsibleRelationsSystematic2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Health","container-title-short":"Front Digit Health","DOI":"10.3389/fdgth.2021.689750","ISSN":"2673-253X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"689750","PMCID":"PMC8521857","PMID":"34713164","source":"PubMed","title":"Responsible Relations: A Systematic Scoping Review of the Therapeutic Alliance in Text-Based Digital Psychotherapy","title-short":"Responsible Relations","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

Youth care professionals were forced to turn to telehealth tools, such as video calling and e-health methods, to be able to continue support and treatment of children, adolescents, caregivers, and families. This study consists of two qualitative interview studies on the experiences with and transition to telehealth during COVID-19: (1) interviews with youth care professionals (N = 20), and (2) interviews with adolescents who used mental health care support (N = 14). We specifically asked participants about five themes which were selected based on pre-COVID literature on telehealth: (1) tools (i.e., which programs are being used), (2) privacy, (3) methods (i.e., what was the same and what was different compared to in-person sessions), (4) relationship/therapeutic alliance, and (5) effectiveness (i.e., what was their impression of effectiveness of telehealth). The majority of professionals reported that they had very little to no experience with telehealth prior to the pandemic. Both professionals and adolescent clients mentioned benefits and limitations of telehealth. On several themes professionals and adolescent clients mentioned similar barriers in the transition to telehealth during COVID such as limitations of the available hard- and software (theme 1: tools); forced changes in the content and methods of the sessions (theme 3: methods); and difficulties with non-verbal communication (theme 4: alliance). However, whereas most professionals expressed the intention to keep using several aspects of telehealth after restrictions due to COVID are lifted, most adolescent clients expressed they see telehealth as a temporary solution and prefer meeting professionals in person. Their experiences and the barriers and enabling aspects they mentioned may provide important insights in the acceptability and usability of telehealth for youth care organizations, youth care professionals, researchers and higher educational training programs.","author":[{"family":"Rooij","given":"Floor B.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Weeland","given":"Joyce"},{"family":"Thonies","given":"Carlo"}],"citation-key":"vanrooijYouthCareTime2023","container-title":"Children and Youth Services Review","container-title-short":"Child Youth Serv Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.childyouth.2023.106874","ISSN":"0190-7409","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"106874","PMCID":"PMC9925417","PMID":"36817405","source":"PubMed","title":"Youth care in time of COVID-19: Experiences of professionals and adolescent clients with telehealth","title-short":"Youth care in time of COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"148"},
  {"id":"villaniSymptomsSatisfactionOptimizing2025","abstract":"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial, chronic, and often relapsing condition with a significant impact on patient quality of life (QoL). Symptoms such as ocular discomfort and visual disturbances are diverse and frequently misaligned with objective clinical signs, complicating diagnosis and management. DED not only interferes with daily activities like reading, driving, and computer use but also imposes a substantial economic burden due to direct healthcare costs and reduced work productivity. Beyond its ocular manifestations, DED has been associated with higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety, with a complex bidirectional relationship. Patients with DED may experience psychological distress that exacerbates symptoms, leading to a vicious cycle that further impairs QoL. This underscores the importance of integrating mental health screening into the management of DED, particularly for high-risk populations. Optimizing the care of DED patients requires empathy, effective communication, and the establishment of a therapeutic alliance that acknowledges patient experiences and involves them in personalized treatment plans. Such an approach can improve patient satisfaction, enhance treatment adherence, and address both ocular and psychological dimensions of the disease.

The present study provides the feasibility evidence on patient-relevant structural and procedure effects of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing LSVT-Loud telerehabilitation (Tele-LSVT-Loud) versus standard delivery.\nMETHODS: Twenty-one people with MS (six males) with dysphonia were 1:1 randomly allocated to 4 weeks of LSVT-Loud in-site or Tele-LSVT-Loud at home accessing a telemedicine platform. The feasibility of Tele-LSVT-Loud compared to LSVT-Loud was evaluated considering adherence rate, safety (adverse events), technology interaction (User Experience Questionnaire), intrinsic motivation to the treatment (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory), and perceived rehabilitation experience (individual qualitative interviews) during and after the intervention program.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one percent of eligible subjects were unavailable to follow in-site treatment. Drops-outs were higher in the LSVT-Loud than Tele-LSVT-Loud group (4 versus 1). Also, the adherence rate of synchronous sessions was 68.75% in the LSVT-Loud compared to 87.5% in the Tele-LSVT-Loud group, related to greater difficulty in integrating the treatment into a daily routine, as mentioned in the qualitative interview. No relevant adverse events were observed in both groups. The user experience with technology in the Tele-LSVT-Loud group was positive. The interviews revealed a positive therapeutic alliance, regardless of the delivery path. Interestingly, only people in the Tele-LSVT-Loud group judged equivalent the therapist-user relationship in in-site and telerehabilitation settings.\nCONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation promotes the feasibility of LSVT-Loud. The modality of delivery is a relevant factor in determining eligibility and adherence to a voice rehabilitation program in MS.","author":[{"family":"Vitali","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Fusari","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Cacciatore","given":"Diego Michael"},{"family":"Smecca","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Baldanzi","given":"Cinzia"},{"family":"Carullo","given":"Alessio"},{"family":"Rovaris","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Cattaneo","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Baglio","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Isernia","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"vitaliDeliveringLeeSilverman2025","container-title":"Digital Health","container-title-short":"Digit Health","DOI":"10.1177/20552076251326222","ISSN":"2055-2076","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"eng","page":"20552076251326222","PMCID":"PMC12107005","PMID":"40433301","source":"PubMed","title":"Delivering the Lee Silverman voice treatment-loud method in-site versus telerehabilitation in people with multiple sclerosis: Feasibility evidence of a non-inferiority pilot randomized controlled trial","title-short":"Delivering the Lee Silverman voice treatment-loud method in-site versus telerehabilitation in people with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"vitgerDigitalSharedDecisionMaking2021","abstract":"Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) in mental healthcare has received increased attention as a process to reinforce person-centered care. With the rapid development of digital health technology, researchers investigate how digital interventions may be utilized to support SDM. Despite the promise of digital interventions to support SDM, the effect of these in mental healthcare has not been evaluated before. Thus, this paper aims to assess the effect of SDM interventions complimented by digital technology in mental healthcare. Objective: The objective of this review was to systematically examine the effectiveness of digital SDM interventions on patient outcomes as investigated in randomized trials. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on digital SDM interventions for people with a mental health condition. We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategy included terms relating to SDM, digital systems, mental health conditions, and study type. The primary outcome was patient activation or indices of the same (e.g., empowerment and self-efficacy), adherence to treatment, hospital admissions, severity of symptoms, and level of functioning. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction, decisional conflict, working alliance, usage, and adherence of medicine; and adverse events were defined as harms or side effects. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria with outcome data from 2,400 participants. Digital SDM interventions had a moderate positive effect as compared with a control condition on patient activation [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.56, CI: 0.10, 1.01, p = 0.02], a small effect on general symptoms (SMD = -0.17, CI: -0.31, -0.03, p = 0.02), and working alliance (SMD = 0.21, CI: 0.02, 0.41, p = 0.03) and for improving decisional conflict (SMD = -0.37, CI: -0.70, -0.05, p = 0.02). No effect was found on self-efficacy, other types of mental health symptoms, adverse events, or patient satisfaction. A total of 39 outcomes were narratively synthesized with results either favoring the intervention group or showing no significant differences between groups. Studies were generally assessed to have unclear or high risk of bias, and outcomes had a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating of low- or very low-quality evidence. Conclusions: Digital interventions to support SDM may be a promising tool in mental healthcare; but with the limited quality of research, we have little confidence in the estimates of effect. More quality research is needed to further assess the effectiveness of digital means to support SDM but also to determine which digital intervention features are most effective to support SDM.

  {"id":"vitgerSmartphoneAppPromote2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process aimed at facilitating patient-centered care by ensuring that the patient and provider are actively involved in treatment decisions. In mental health care, SDM has been advocated as a means for the patient to gain or regain control and responsibility over their life and recovery process. To support the process of patient-centered care and SDM, digital tools may have advantages in terms of accessibility, structure, and reminders.\nOBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate the effect of a digital tool to support patient activation and SDM.\nMETHODS: The trial was designed as a randomized, assessor-blinded, 2-armed, parallel-group multicenter trial investigating the use of a digital SDM intervention for 6 months compared with treatment as usual. Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder were recruited from 9 outpatient treatment sites in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome was the self-reported level of activation at the postintervention time point. The secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, hope, working alliance, satisfaction, preparedness for treatment consultation, symptom severity, and level of functioning. Explorative outcomes on the effect of the intervention at the midintervention time point along with objective data on the use of the digital tool were collected.\nRESULTS: In total, 194 participants were included. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a statistically significant effect favoring the intervention group on patient activation (mean difference 4.39, 95% CI 0.99-7.79; Cohen d=0.33; P=.01), confidence in communicating with one's provider (mean difference 1.85, 95% CI 0.01-3.69; Cohen d=0.24; P=.05), and feeling prepared for decision-making (mean difference 5.12, 95% CI 0.16-10.08; Cohen d=0.27; P=.04). We found no effect of the digital SDM tool on treatment satisfaction, hope, self-efficacy, working alliance, severity of symptoms, level of functioning, use of antipsychotic medicine, and number or length of psychiatric hospital admissions.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial showed a significant effect of a digital SDM tool on the subjective level of patient activation, confidence in communicating with one's provider, and feeling prepared for decision-making at the postintervention time point. The effect size was smaller than the 0.42 effect size that we had anticipated and sampled for. The trial contributes to the evidence on how digital tools may support patient-centered care and SDM in mental health care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03554655; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03554655.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-doi: 10.1186/s12888-019-2143-2.","author":[{"family":"Vitger","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Hjorthøj","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Austin","given":"Stephen F."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Lone"},{"family":"Tønder","given":"Esben Sandvik"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Merete"},{"family":"Korsbek","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"vitgerSmartphoneAppPromote2022","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/40292","ISSN":"1438-8871","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"e40292","PMCID":"PMC9647453","PMID":"36287604","source":"PubMed","title":"A Smartphone App to Promote Patient Activation and Support Shared Decision-making in People With a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia in Outpatient Treatment Settings (Momentum Trial): Randomized Controlled Assessor-Blinded Trial","title-short":"A Smartphone App to Promote Patient Activation and Support Shared Decision-making in People With a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia in Outpatient Treatment Settings (Momentum Trial)","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

There is limited information available in the published psychiatric literature pertaining to the use of this technology for commitment proceedings. The University of North Carolina Hospitals adopted a remote videoconferencing (tele-hearing) format for its civil commitment proceedings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and this provided us with the opportunity to investigate the use of such an arrangement. In this article, we review the use of videoconferencing for commitment hearings. We also review select case law related to the utilization of this technology for commitment hearings, which reveals that the courts have not been in full agreement about the legality of a virtual commitment tele-hearing format. Given that the general use of virtual platforms has expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic and many individuals and organizations are gaining confidence in operating this technology, more institutions may decide to shift to a virtual commitment scheme or make a commitment tele-hearing format permanent after the pandemic.","author":[{"family":"Vitiello","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Joseph B."}],"citation-key":"vitielloVideoconferencingInvoluntaryCommitment2021","container-title":"The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law","container-title-short":"J Am Acad Psychiatry Law","DOI":"10.29158/JAAPL.210032-21","ISSN":"1943-3662","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"610-617","PMID":"34001669","source":"PubMed","title":"Videoconferencing of Involuntary Commitment Hearings in the COVID Era","type":"article-journal","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"voelterTeletherapyCochlearImplantation2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digitalization in healthcare grew rapidly. Auditory training after cochlear implantation usually takes place face-to-face but social distancing interferes with this therapeutic approach.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In follow-up treatment, 42 adult cochlear implant (CI) users aged 53.8 (±15.6) years received video therapy 1 x/week for 5 weeks on a certified platform. After each therapy session, the technical process and therapeutic content were assessed. At the end of the study, usability and the relationship between therapist and patient were evaluated by patients and therapists using the System Usability Scale (SUS), a final questionnaire and by the Skala Therapeutische Allianz - Revised (STA-R). Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis was done.\nRESULTS: Usability for both users was high (87.97 versus 93.0). Despite the lack of personal contact, therapeutic alliance was highly appreciated by patients and therapists (87.8% versus 84.8%). The main advantages for the patients were reductions in time and costs. In contrast, the rehabilitation center faced higher costs initially due to the longer time therapists needed to prepare the lessons. Technical problems had to be solved in > 75% of the first sessions but did not bother training thereafter. In total, 47.6% of the patients believe that teletherapy can completely fulfill their therapeutic needs.\nCONCLUSION: Video therapy has been judged as a useful tool by all users and the majority wants to continue. However, it remains questionable whether the therapist-patient relationship can be sufficiently maintained over a longer period and whether online therapy is as effective as face-to-face therapy.","author":[{"family":"Völter","given":"Christiane"},{"family":"Stöckmann","given":"Carolin"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Dazert","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Jan Peter"}],"citation-key":"voelterTeletherapyCochlearImplantation2022","container-title":"HNO","container-title-short":"HNO","DOI":"10.1007/s00106-021-01124-y","ISSN":"1433-0458","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"ger","page":"214-223","PMCID":"PMC8620318","PMID":"34825919","source":"PubMed","title":"[Teletherapy after cochlear implantation during the COVID-19 pandemic]","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"vollertEffectivenessAppBasedShort2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve sleep shows promising effects. The interventions investigated so far have been primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience and be more suitable for daily use.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to improve their sleep.\nMETHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an app-based short intervention (Refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist condition. Refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and including a sleep diary. The primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). The secondary outcomes were depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score) and perceived insomnia-related impairment.\nRESULTS: We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. About 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average 4 out of 8 chapters. Retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% (n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. At postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention group were maintained at follow-up. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre- to postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good.\nCONCLUSIONS: An app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective option to scale-up CBT-I-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence need to be carefully addressed.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN53553517; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN53553517.","author":[{"family":"Vollert","given":"Bianka"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Luise"},{"family":"Jacobi","given":"Corinna"},{"family":"Trockel","given":"Mickey"},{"family":"Beintner","given":"Ina"}],"citation-key":"vollertEffectivenessAppBasedShort2023","container-title":"JMIR mental health","container-title-short":"JMIR Ment Health","DOI":"10.2196/39052","ISSN":"2368-7959","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"e39052","PMCID":"PMC10131838","PMID":"36943337","source":"PubMed","title":"Effectiveness of an App-Based Short Intervention to Improve Sleep: Randomized Controlled Trial","title-short":"Effectiveness of an App-Based Short Intervention to Improve Sleep","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

However, there is skepticism about its acceptance, safety, and efficacy for patients with high emotional and behavioral dysregulation.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide initial effect size estimates of symptom change from pre- to post treatment, and the acceptance and safety of telehealth dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nMETHODS: A total of 39 individuals meeting the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fifth Edition]) criteria for BPD received 1 year of outpatient telehealth DBT at 3 sites in Germany and Canada. Effect size estimates were assessed using pre-post measures of BPD symptoms, dissociation, and quality of life. Safety was evaluated by analyzing suicide attempts and self-harm. Additionally, acceptance and feasibility, satisfaction with treatment, useability of the telehealth format, and the quality of the therapeutic alliance were assessed from both therapists' and patients' perspectives. All analyses were conducted on both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and according-to-protocol (ATP) samples.\nRESULTS: Analyses showed significant and large pre-post effect sizes for BPD symptoms (d=1.13 in the ITT sample and d=1.44 in the ATP sample; P<.001) and for quality of life (d=0.65 in the ITT sample and d=1.24 in the ATP sample). Dissociative symptoms showed small to nonsignificant reductions. Self-harm behaviors decreased significantly from 80% to 28% of all patients showing at least 1 self-harm behavior in the last 10 weeks (risk ratio 0.35). A high dropout rate of 38% was observed. One low-lethality suicide attempt was reported. Acceptance, feasibility, and satisfaction measures were high, although therapists reported only moderate useability of the telehealth format.\nCONCLUSIONS: Telehealth DBT for BPD showed large pre-post effect sizes for BPD symptoms and quality of life. While the telehealth format appeared feasible and well-accepted, the dropout rate was relatively high. Future research should compare the efficacy of telehealth DBT with in-person formats in randomized controlled trials. Overall, telehealth DBT might offer a potentially effective alternative treatment option, enhancing treatment accessibility.

We investigate two such methods (video-based vs. verbal report-based supervision) in a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-three supervisees were trained in common cognitive-behavioral therapy methods (i.e. behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) by means of written information and a modelling video demonstrating the techniques. Supervisees had to apply the techniques in role plays with standardized patients (presenting depressive patients). Subsequently, supervisees were randomized to supervision, based on the video, or supervision based on the verbal report of the supervisees. Subsequently and after a three-month follow-up period, supervisees had to demonstrate the therapeutic techniques again. Therapist competence, therapeutic alliance, empathy, and anxiety were assessed through various different perspectives (i.e. independent raters, standardized patients, and supervisees' self-evaluation). Both supervision conditions lead to a significant improvement of therapeutic competences, therapeutic alliance, and empathy. No significant differences were found between the two supervision conditions. At three-month follow-up, training effects decreased on all perspectives except standardized patients. A training condition without supervision would be necessary to demonstrate that improvements are specific effects of the supervision conditions.

  {"id":"wienholdRelationshipEarlyLife2025","abstract":"In any therapeutic setting, the outcome depends in part on the therapeutic alliance, characterized by mutual understanding, empathy and trust among the participants. This also manifests through physiological synchronization (PS) processes involving breathing, heart and brain. This study examined the dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) synchronization patterns during horse-assisted therapy. We explored the correlations between the therapist's horse preference, levels of early life adversity (ELA), and PS relationships within and across dyads of participants, therapists, and therapy horses. Our sample of 42 female participants engaged in standardized horse-assisted therapy sessions facilitated by three riding therapists and four therapy horses. PS was operationalized through cross-wavelet power analyses across the different dyads. The results showed, that stronger HRV synchronization between the therapist and horse was associated with stronger HRV synchronization between the horse and participant, as well as stronger HRV synchronization between the therapist and participant. We found a correlation between ELA and HRV synchronization between participants and therapists, with individuals experiencing higher levels of ELA showing lower synchronization. However, this effect of ELA was not observed for HRV synchronization between participants and horses. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the riding therapist's preference for a particular therapy horse and the HRV synchronization between the therapist and that horse. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the correlational dynamics in horse-human interactions and may have potential implications for optimizing therapeutic interventions in clinical settings.","author":[{"family":"Wienhold","given":"Stella"},{"family":"Bär","given":"Larissa"},{"family":"Ringleb","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Zirpel","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Gomolla","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Denk","given":"Bernadette F."},{"family":"Volkmer","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Gaertner","given":"Raphaela J."},{"family":"Klink","given":"Elea S.

We investigated TMH providers' perceptions about remote care one year into the pandemic according to when providers adopted telemedicine (i.e., before vs. after March 2020) and how much of their caseloads were served remotely (i.e., < 50% vs. ≥ 50%). Between February-March 2021, 472 TMH providers completed a cross-sectional, web-based survey that measured perceived benefits and satisfaction with telemedicine, therapeutic alliance, patient-centered communication, eHealth literacy, multicultural counseling self-efficacy, and facilitating factors of using telemedicine. Providers who began using telemedicine before the pandemic reported having better training, task-related therapeutic alliance with patients, and ability to conduct multicultural interventions, assessments, and session management. Providers who served ≥ 50% of their caseload remotely reported greater satisfaction with their practice, stronger beliefs about the benefits of telemedicine, and greater perceived effects of telemedicine on alleviating the impact of COVID-19. There were no differences in reports of patient-centered communication nor eHealth literacy. In conclusion, providers who adopted TMH more recently may require additional training and support to successfully establish a working alliance with their patients, especially with multicultural aspects of care.","author":[{"family":"Wilczewski","given":"Hattie"},{"family":"Paige","given":"Samantha R."},{"family":"Ong","given":"Triton"},{"family":"Barrera","given":"Janelle F."},{"family":"Soni","given":"Hiral"},{"family":"Welch","given":"Brandon M."},{"family":"Bunnell","given":"Brian E."}],"citation-key":"wilczewskiPerceptionsTelementalHealth2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.855138","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"855138","PMCID":"PMC9013879","PMID":"35444579","source":"PubMed","title":"Perceptions of Telemental Health Care Delivery During COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study With Providers, February-March 2021","title-short":"Perceptions of Telemental Health Care Delivery During COVID-19","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"witteveenRemoteMentalHealth2022","abstract":"Mitigating the COVID-19 related disruptions in mental health care services is crucial in a time of increased mental health disorders. Numerous reviews have been conducted on the process of implementing technology-based mental health care during the pandemic. The research question of this umbrella review was to examine what the impact of COVID-19 was on access and delivery of mental health services and how mental health services have changed during the pandemic. A systematic search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was conducted up to August 12, 2022, and 38 systematic reviews were identified. Main disruptions during COVID-19 were reduced access to outpatient mental health care and reduced admissions and earlier discharge from inpatient care. In response, synchronous telemental health tools such as videoconferencing were used to provide remote care similar to pre-COVID care, and to a lesser extent asynchronous virtual mental health tools such as apps. Implementation of synchronous tools were facilitated by time-efficiency and flexibility during the pandemic but there was a lack of accessibility for specific vulnerable populations. Main barriers among practitioners and patients to use digital mental health tools were poor technological literacy, particularly when preexisting inequalities existed, and beliefs about reduced therapeutic alliance particularly in case of severe mental disorders. Absence of organizational support for technological implementation of digital mental health interventions due to inadequate IT infrastructure, lack of funding, as well as lack of privacy and safety, challenged implementation during COVID-19. Reviews were of low to moderate quality, covered heterogeneously designed primary studies and lacked findings of implementation in low- and middle-income countries. These gaps in the evidence were particularly prevalent in studies conducted early in the pandemic. This umbrella review shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, practitioners and mental health care institutions mainly used synchronous telemental health tools, and to a lesser degree asynchronous tools to enable continued access to mental health care for patients. Numerous barriers to these tools were identified, and call for further improvements. In addition, more high quality research into comparative effectiveness and working mechanisms may improve scalability of mental health care in general and in future infectious disease outbreaks.","author":[{"family":"Witteveen","given":"A.

  {"id":"wuExaminingImpactDigital2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety incur significant personal and societal costs. Effective psychotherapies exist, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); however, timely access to quality care is limited by myriad barriers. Blended care therapy models incorporate traditional face-to-face therapy with scalable, digital components of care, expanding the reach of evidence-based care.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a blended care CBT program (BC-CBT) in real-world settings and examine the unique impacts of the (1) digital components of care (video lessons and digital exercises) and (2) phase of treatment (early versus late) in decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 3401 US-based individuals enrolled in a BC-CBT program, who presented with clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety. The treatment program consisted of regular therapy sessions augmented by clinician-assigned digital video lessons and exercises. A growth curve model incorporating time-varying covariates examined the relationship between engagement with BCT components (ie, therapy sessions, digital video lessons, and digital exercises) during the early (weeks 0-7) and late (weeks 8-15) phases of treatment, and weekly symptom reports on depression and anxiety measures.\nRESULTS: On average, a significant decline in depression and anxiety symptoms was observed during the initial weeks of treatment (P<.001), with a continued, though slower, decline over subsequent weeks (P<.001). Each session completed was associated with significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.72) and depression (b=-0.83) in the early phase, as well as in the late phase (anxiety, b=-0.47; depression, b=-0.27). Significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.15) and depression (b=-0.12) were observed for time spent on video lessons (measured in 10-minute intervals) in the early phase of treatment. Engaging with exercises was associated with statistically significant increases in anxiety symptoms (b=0.03) during the early phase of treatment. However, sensitivity analyses examining the effects of exercises in isolation revealed significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.05) in the early phase, suggesting a potential suppression effect in the larger model.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using a retrospective cohort design, therapy sessions and digital video lessons were uniquely predictive of improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, and their effects were modulated based on the phase of treatment (early vs late). Future research should investigate whether other treatment variables, such as therapeutic alliance or familiarity with technology, are related to differential effects on various components of care.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Monica S."},{"family":"Wickham","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shih-Yin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Connie"},{"family":"Lungu","given":"Anita"}],"citation-key":"wuExaminingImpactDigital2021","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/33452","ISSN":"2561-326X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,17]]},"language":"eng","page":"e33452","PMCID":"PMC8726023","PMID":"34927591","source":"PubMed","title":"Examining the Impact of Digital Components Across Different Phases of Treatment in a Blended Care Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Depression and Anxiety: Pragmatic Retrospective Study","title-short":"Examining the Impact of Digital Components Across Different Phases of Treatment in a Blended Care Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Depression and Anxiety","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"wullnerUseMobileApps2025","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Therapy-accompanying mental health apps can play an important role in the psychotherapeutic treatment of adolescents. They can enhance adolescents' engagement and autonomy, provide immediate support in critical situations, and positively influence the therapeutic working alliance. Nevertheless, mental health apps are rarely used by psychotherapists. Furthermore, due to the limited or nonexistent use of apps in psychotherapy, little is known about the actual barriers and drivers affecting their integration into psychotherapists' daily routines. To better understand how mental health apps should be designed for practical use, it is essential to explore psychotherapists' perspectives on key app features and characteristics, as well as the factors influencing their integration into clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze which app features and characteristics are essential for psychotherapists to use a mobile app in psychotherapy with adolescents and to identify the key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of a psychotherapeutic app from the psychotherapists' perspectives.\nMETHODS: We conducted 3 feasibility studies using Steps, a transdiagnostic, therapy-accompanying app for adolescents, across 3 different psychotherapeutic treatment contexts: inpatient treatment, treatment in psychiatric outpatient clinics, and outpatient treatment with psychotherapists in private practice. All studies followed a qualitative quasi-experimental design. Participants provided information on their age, occupation, years of work experience, media affinity, attitudes toward psychotherapeutic apps, perceived app quality and feasibility, and the implementation process of the therapy-accompanying app. Qualitative data were analyzed using deductive qualitative content analysis. A total of 40 mental health professionals participated across the 3 studies (study 1: n=18; study 2: n=13; study 3: n=9).\nRESULTS: Study participation and app usage rates were low across all studies. Six core features for a transdiagnostic, therapy-accompanying app were identified: mood checks, library, reminders, goals and tasks, emergency kit, and questionnaires. Additionally, the integration of mental health apps into daily routines was influenced by various drivers and barriers. The most significant barriers included technological issues and practical constraints, such as limited time and resources. The most important driver was the perceived improvement in treatment quality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, psychotherapists were generally open to using a therapy-accompanying mental health app. However, study participation and app usage remained low. As psychotherapists act as gatekeepers for patients' use of mental health apps, their needs should be prioritized in the development and implementation of such apps.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00031258; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00031258/details.","author":[{"family":"Wüllner","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Hermenau","given":"Katharin"},{"family":"Hecker","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Siniatchkin","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"wullnerUseMobileApps2025","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/65788","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"e65788","PMCID":"PMC12015344","PMID":"40198916","source":"PubMed","title":"The Use of Mobile Apps in Adolescent Psychotherapy: Assessment of Psychotherapists' Perspectives","title-short":"The Use of Mobile Apps in Adolescent Psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"wutzFactorsInfluencingAcceptability2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are digital dialog systems that enable people to have a text-based, speech-based, or nonverbal conversation with a computer or another machine based on natural language via an interface. The use of CAs offers new opportunities and various benefits for health care. However, they are not yet ubiquitous in daily practice. Nevertheless, research regarding the implementation of CAs in health care has grown tremendously in recent years.\nOBJECTIVE: This review aims to present a synthesis of the factors that facilitate or hinder the implementation of CAs from the perspectives of patients and health care professionals. Specifically, it focuses on the early implementation outcomes of acceptability, acceptance, and adoption as cornerstones of later implementation success.\nMETHODS: We performed an integrative review. To identify relevant literature, a broad literature search was conducted in June 2021 with no date limits and using all fields in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LIVIVO, and PsycINFO. To keep the review current, another search was conducted in March 2022. To identify as many eligible primary sources as possible, we used a snowballing approach by searching reference lists and conducted a hand search. Factors influencing the acceptability, acceptance, and adoption of CAs in health care were coded through parallel deductive and inductive approaches, which were informed by current technology acceptance and adoption models. Finally, the factors were synthesized in a thematic map.\nRESULTS: Overall, 76 studies were included in this review. We identified influencing factors related to 4 core Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation), with most studies underlining the relevance of performance and effort expectancy. To meet the particularities of the health care context, we redefined the UTAUT2 factors social influence, habit, and price value. We identified 6 other influencing factors: perceived risk, trust, anthropomorphism, health issue, working alliance, and user characteristics. Overall, we identified 10 factors influencing acceptability, acceptance, and adoption among health care professionals (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, price value, perceived risk, trust, anthropomorphism, working alliance, and user characteristics) and 13 factors influencing acceptability, acceptance, and adoption among patients (additionally hedonic motivation, habit, and health issue).\nCONCLUSIONS: This review shows manifold factors influencing the acceptability, acceptance, and adoption of CAs in health care. Knowledge of these factors is fundamental for implementation planning. Therefore, the findings of this review can serve as a basis for future studies to develop appropriate implementation strategies. Furthermore, this review provides an empirical test of current technology acceptance and adoption models and identifies areas where additional research is necessary.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022343690; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=343690.","author":[{"family":"Wutz","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Hermes","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Köberlein-Neu","given":"Juliane"}],"citation-key":"wutzFactorsInfluencingAcceptability2023","container-title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","container-title-short":"J Med Internet Res","DOI":"10.2196/46548","ISSN":"1438-8871","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"e46548","PMCID":"PMC10565637","PMID":"37751279","source":"PubMed","title":"Factors Influencing the Acceptability, Acceptance, and Adoption of Conversational Agents in Health Care: Integrative Review","title-short":"Factors Influencing the Acceptability, Acceptance, and Adoption of Conversational Agents in Health Care","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"yaoImpactScaffoldedNonscaffolded2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Clinicians working with patients at risk of suicide often experience high stress, which can result in negative emotional responses (NERs). Such negative emotional responses may lead to less empathic communication (EC) and unintentional rejection of the patient, potentially damaging the therapeutic alliance and adversely impacting suicidal outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need training to effectively manage negative emotions toward suicidal patients to improve suicidal outcomes.\nMETHODS: This study investigated the impact of virtual human interaction (VHI) training on clinicians' self-awareness of their negative emotional responses, assessed by the Therapist Response Questionnaire Suicide Form, clinicians' verbal empathic communication assessed by the Empathic Communication and Coding System, and clinical efficacy (CE). Clinical efficacy was assessed by the likelihood of subsequent appointments, perceived helpfulness, and overall interaction satisfaction as rated by individuals with lived experience of suicide attempts. Two conditions of virtual human interactions were used: one with instructions on verbal empathic communication and reminders to report negative emotional responses during the interaction (scaffolded); and the other with no such instructions or reminders (non-scaffolded). Both conditions provided pre-interaction instructions and post-interaction feedback aimed at improving clinicians' empathic communication and management of negative emotions. Sixty-two clinicians participated in three virtual human interaction sessions under one of the two conditions. Linear mixed models were utilized to evaluate the impact on clinicians' negative emotional responses, verbal empathic communication, and clinical efficacy; and to determine changes in these outcomes over time, as moderated by the training conditions.\nRESULTS: Clinician participants' negative emotional responses decreased after two training sessions with virtual human interactions in both conditions. Participants in the scaffolded condition exhibited enhanced empathic communication after one training session, while two sessions were required for participants in the non-scaffolded condition. Surprisingly, after two training sessions, clinical efficacy was improved in the non-scaffolded group, while no similar improvements were observed in the scaffolded group.\nCONCLUSION: Lower clinical efficacy after virtual human interaction training in clinicians with higher verbal empathic communication suggests that nonverbal expressions of empathy are critical when interacting with suicidal patients.

  {"id":"yuanCommunicatingParentsPreschool2021","abstract":"The aim of this study was to explore communication interactions and identify phases adopted by dental professionals with parents and their young children and to examine the hypothesis that successful social talking between the actors together with the containment of worries allows the formation of a triadic treatment alliance, which leads to achieving preventive dental treatment goals. Conversation analysis of the transcribed data from video recordings of dental professionals, parents and preschool children when attending for preventive dental care was conducted. The transcriptions were read, examined and analysed independently to ensure the trustworthiness of the analysis. The transcriptions were explored for interactive patterns and sequences of interaction. Forty-four individual consultations between dental professionals, parents, and preschool children were recorded. The number of communication behaviours was 7,299, with appointment length ranging from 2 min 10 s to 29 min 18 s. Two patterns of communication were identified as dyadic (between two people) and triadic (between three people) interactions within a continuous shifting cycle. The three phases of communication were social talking, containing worries and task-focusing. Social talking was characterised by shifts between dyadic and triadic communication interactions and a symmetry of communication turns and containing worries. This typified the cyclical nature of the triadic and dyadic communication interactions, the adoption of talk-turn pairs, and triadic treatment alliance formation. Task-focusing pattern and structure were different for dentists and extended-duty dental nurses. For dentists, task-focusing was characterised by a dyadic interaction and as an asymmetrical communication pattern: for extended-duty dental nurses, task-focusing was typified by symmetrical and asymmetrical communication patterns within dyadic and triadic interactions. Empathy and understanding of the young child's emotional needs during containing worries allowed the formation of the triadic treatment alliance and with this treatment alliance, the acceptance of interventions to prevent early childhood caries during \"task-focusing.\" This qualitative exploration suggests that dyadic and triadic communication interactions are of a dynamic and cyclical quality and were exhibited during paediatric dental consultations. The communication phases of social talking, containing worries and task-focusing were evident. Successful social talking signalled the entry to containing worries and triadic treatment alliance formation which permitted the preventive goals of the consultation to be achieved (task-focusing). Future work should generate additional data to support the hypotheses created here namely that, social talking and containing worries triggers an integral pathway to task-focusing and the achievement of preventive dental goals.","author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Siyang"},{"family":"Humphris","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"MacPherson","given":"Lorna M.

  {"id":"zechIntegrativeEngagementModel2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions, such as 2-way and asynchronous messaging therapy, are a growing part of the mental health care treatment ecosystem, yet little is known about how users engage with these interventions over the course of their treatment journeys. User engagement, or client behaviors and therapeutic relationships that facilitate positive treatment outcomes, is a necessary condition for the effectiveness of any digital treatment. Developing a better understanding of the factors that impact user engagement can impact the overall effectiveness of digital psychotherapy. Mapping the user experience in digital therapy may be facilitated by integrating theories from several fields. Specifically, health science's Health Action Process Approach and human-computer interaction's Lived Informatics Model may be usefully synthesized with relational constructs from psychotherapy process-outcome research to identify the determinants of engagement in digital messaging therapy.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to capture insights into digital therapy users' engagement patterns through a qualitative analysis of focus group sessions. We aimed to synthesize emergent intrapersonal and relational determinants of engagement into an integrative framework of engagement in digital therapy.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 focus group participants were recruited to participate in 1 of 5 synchronous focus group sessions held between October and November 2021. Participant responses were coded by 2 researchers using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Coders identified 10 relevant constructs and 24 subconstructs that can collectively account for users' engagement and experience trajectories in the context of digital therapy. Although users' engagement trajectories in digital therapy varied widely, they were principally informed by intrapsychic factors (eg, self-efficacy and outcome expectancy), interpersonal factors (eg, the therapeutic alliance and its rupture), and external factors (eg, treatment costs and social support). These constructs were organized into a proposed Integrative Engagement Model of Digital Psychotherapy. Notably, every participant in the focus groups indicated that their ability to connect with their therapist was among the most important factors that were considered in continuing or terminating treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Engagement in messaging therapy may be usefully approached through an interdisciplinary lens, linking constructs from health science, human-computer interaction studies, and clinical science in an integrative engagement framework. Taken together, our results suggest that users may not view the digital psychotherapy platform itself as a treatment so much as a means of gaining access to a helping provider, that is, users did not see themselves as engaging with a platform but instead viewed their experience as a healing relationship. The findings of this study suggest that a better understanding of user engagement is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions, and future research should continue to explore the underlying factors that contribute to engagement in digital mental health interventions.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04507360; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04507360.","author":[{"family":"Zech","given":"James M."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Pullmann","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Hull","given":"Thomas D."},{"family":"Althoff","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Munson","given":"Sean A."},{"family":"Fridling","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Litvin","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jerilyn"},{"family":"Areán","given":"Patricia A."}],"citation-key":"zechIntegrativeEngagementModel2023","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/41428","ISSN":"2561-326X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"e41428","PMCID":"PMC10173033","PMID":"37099363","source":"PubMed","title":"An Integrative Engagement Model of Digital Psychotherapy: Exploratory Focus Group Findings","title-short":"An Integrative Engagement Model of Digital Psychotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"zeilerTherapistsPerspectivesMaudsley2025","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: A rising incidence of eating disorders in the young population and limited effectiveness of available treatment approaches underscore the need for innovative therapies. This study explores therapists' perspectives regarding a promising new manualized psychotherapeutic treatment (MANTRa) for adolescents and young adults with anorexia nervosa (AN).\nMETHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 therapists (nine female) who provided 24-34 sessions of MANTRa per patient. Interview topics included positive and negative experiences with MANTRa in general, with the workbook and other components. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. Furthermore, written notes taken by the therapists after each sessions were analysed.\nRESULTS: The thematic analysis revealed five overarching themes: (1) Variety of therapeutic tools and content elements included in the workbook; (2) Getting the therapeutic process going; (3) Flexibility in use of the workbook; (4) Impact of the scientific and multidisciplinary framework on quality assurance; (5) Formal design of the workbook. Therapists' case formulation letters to the patients were regarded as powerful tools to strengthen therapeutic alliance and promote recovery. In-depth therapists' training, regular supervision and a multi-professional treatment setting were important factors to ensure high treatment quality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest how the MANTRa content (e.g. inclusion of additional therapeutic tools), the therapists' training and the format (e.g. provision of a digital version) can be improved to reach maximum impact. Therapists' formulation letters may be an effective therapeutic tool not only for AN but also across the spectrum of psychiatric disorders in adolescents and young adults.","author":[{"family":"Zeiler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sackl-Pammer","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Wittek","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Ohmann","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Werneck-Rohrer","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Truttmann","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Philipp","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Schöfbeck","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Kopp","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Krauss","given":"Helene"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Karwautz","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Gudrun"}],"citation-key":"zeilerTherapistsPerspectivesMaudsley2025","container-title":"Psychology and Psychotherapy","container-title-short":"Psychol Psychother","DOI":"10.1111/papt.12562","ISSN":"2044-8341","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"396-415","PMCID":"PMC12065047","PMID":"39623911","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapists' perspectives on the Maudsley model anorexia nervosa treatment for adolescents and young adults (MANTRa): A qualitative interview study","title-short":"Therapists' perspectives on the Maudsley model anorexia nervosa treatment for adolescents and young adults (MANTRa)","type":"article-journal","volume":"98"},
  {"id":"zentnerCliniciansAttitudesTelepsychology2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented uptake of telepsychology services; however, clinicians have mixed attitudes toward virtual technologies.\nOBJECTIVE: This study (1) explored clinicians' experiences of and intentions to use video, telephone, and in-person services, and (2) tested the utility of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to predict clinicians' intentions to offer telepsychology after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: Clinician satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were compared across in-person, video, and telephone services, while technology attitudes and intention to use after the pandemic were compared across video and telephone services among 118 addiction and mental health clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRESULTS: Clinicians reported more positive experiences with in-person services than both virtual technologies; further, clinicians reported greater positive experiences, attitudes, and intentions to use video services than telephone services across measures. Based on the UTAUT, performance expectancy positively predicted concurrent intentions to use video services (β=0.46; P<.001) and telephone services (β=0.35; P<.001) after the pandemic. Social influence (β=0.24; P=.004) and facilitating conditions (β=0.19; P=.03) additionally predicted the intention to use telephone services.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians rated in-person services more positively than virtual technologies, with video services perceived more positively than telephone services. Performance expectancy was the primary facilitator of the uptake of both virtual modalities.","author":[{"family":"Zentner","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Gaine","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Ethridge","given":"Paige"},{"family":"Surood","given":"Shireen"},{"family":"Abba-Aji","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"zentnerCliniciansAttitudesTelepsychology2022","container-title":"JMIR formative research","container-title-short":"JMIR Form Res","DOI":"10.2196/35535","ISSN":"2561-326X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,13]]},"language":"eng","page":"e35535","PMCID":"PMC9143772","PMID":"35559793","source":"PubMed","title":"Clinicians' Attitudes Toward Telepsychology in Addiction and Mental Health Services, and Prediction of Postpandemic Telepsychology Uptake: Cross-sectional Study","title-short":"Clinicians' Attitudes Toward Telepsychology in Addiction and Mental Health Services, and Prediction of Postpandemic Telepsychology Uptake","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"zhouPredictingFirstSession2022","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to develop a predictive model based on deep learning algorithms to predict working alliances after the first therapeutic session and to provide a basis for clinical decisions.\nMETHODS: Using a sample of 325 patients and 32 psychotherapists from three university counseling centers, a deep learning algorithm known as fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) was adopted to construct data-driven predictive models. The performance differences between the model including only patient indicators and the model including both patient and therapist indicators were compared. The optimal model was further tested in a general hospital sample of 85 patients and 8 therapists.\nRESULTS: The model incorporating both patient indicators and therapist-level indicators (R²: 0.30 ± 0.02) performed better than the model incorporating only patient indicators (R²: 0.11 ± 0.02). The performance of this model decreased when being transferred to the independent general hospital sample, but still retained some predictive value (R² = 0.11).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that the inclusion of therapist-level indicators can improve the performance of a predictive model in predicting working alliances. This model could assist clinical decisions on choosing psychotherapists for patients and may also initiate new possibilities for future research.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiao-Yu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ding"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Yu-Lin"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Yan-Fei"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Ting-Ting"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiao-Cong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Yuan"}],"citation-key":"zhouPredictingFirstSession2022","container-title":"Psychotherapy Research: Journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","container-title-short":"Psychother Res","DOI":"10.1080/10503307.2022.2078680","ISSN":"1468-4381","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"1100-1109","PMID":"35635836","source":"PubMed","title":"Predicting first session working alliances using deep learning algorithms: A proof-of-concept study for personalized psychotherapy","title-short":"Predicting first session working alliances using deep learning algorithms","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"zimmermannMovementSynchronyPsychotherapy2021","abstract":"Movement synchrony describes the coordination of body movements. In psychotherapy, higher movement synchrony between therapist and patient has been associated with higher levels of empathy, therapeutic alliance, better therapy outcome, and fewer drop-outs. The current study investigated movement synchrony during the psychotherapeutic treatment of female adolescents with borderline personality disorder. It was hypothesized that there are higher levels of movement synchrony in the analyzed therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions. Further, we tested whether higher levels of movement synchrony correlate with stronger patients' symptom reduction and whether higher movement synchrony predicts higher post-session ratings. A total of 356 sessions from 16 completed psychotherapies of adolescent patients with BPD were analyzed. Movement synchrony was assessed with motion energy analysis and an index of synchrony was calculated by lagged cross-correlation analysis. As hypothesized, the findings support higher levels of movement synchrony in therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions (Cohen's d = 0.85). Additionally, a correlation of movement synchrony with better therapy outcome was found (standardized beta = -0.43 indicating stronger personality functioning impairment reduction). The post-session ratings were negatively associated with higher levels of movement synchrony (standardized beta = -0.1). The relevance of movement synchrony and potential implications for clinical practice are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Ronan"},{"family":"Fürer","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Kleinbub","given":"Johann R."},{"family":"Ramseyer","given":"Fabian T."},{"family":"Hütten","given":"Rahel"},{"family":"Steppan","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Schmeck","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"zimmermannMovementSynchronyPsychotherapy2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660516","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"660516","PMCID":"PMC8277930","PMID":"34276484","source":"PubMed","title":"Movement Synchrony in the Psychotherapy of Adolescents With Borderline Personality Pathology - A Dyadic Trait Marker for Resilience?","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"}
