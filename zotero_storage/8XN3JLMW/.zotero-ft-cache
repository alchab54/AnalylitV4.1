ABSTRACT
Aim
To understand patient/family perspective of inappropriate intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and
treatment.
Methods
Rapid literature review of English language articles published between 2001 and 2017 in Medline or
PsycInfo.
Results
Thirteen articles covering 6,194 elderly patients or surrogate decision-makers from four countries
were eligible. Perceived inappropriateness of ICU treatments was mainly expressed as
dissatisfaction with clinicians’ as surrogate decision-makers, inconsistency with patient/family
values, family distrust of physician’s predictions on poor prognosis, and inadequate communication
on over-aggressive treatment causing suffering. Consultation on opinion before ICU admission
varied from 1% to 53.6%, and treatment goals from 1.4 to 31.7%. Satisfaction with the decision
making process in ICU was higher for those who had certain level of control and involvement in the
process.
Conclusions
The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU treatments involves preferences, values
and social constructs beyond medical criteria. Earlier consultation with families before ICU
admission, and patient education on outcomes of life-sustaining therapies may help reconcile these
provider-patient disagreements.

Take-home message
The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU at the end of life often differs from the
clinician’s opinion due to the non-medical frame of mind. To improve satisfaction with
communication on treatment goals, consultation on patient values and inclusion of social
constructs in addition to clinical prediction are a good start to reconcile differences between
physician and health service users’ viewpoint.

Background
Elderly patients at the end of life are high consumers of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU)
services, yet their outcomes remain poor, many die during admission and others die within months
of ICU discharge. [1, [2] Moreover, of those that survive an ICU stay, their long term quality of life
and physical health are often severely compromised after hospital discharge. [3] High quality end
of-life care in ICU has been defined by families as encompassing timely and compassionate
communication, shared decision-making incorporating patient treatment goals and values,
avoidance of prolongation of dying, and preservation of comfort and dignity. [4] Despite this, with
increasingly available technology to prolong life -the medicalisation of death- [5] has resulted in
many of these ICU admissions deemed inappropriate from a medical perspective [6] and in some
cases unwanted by the patients themselves, who would largely prefer less aggressive treatments at
the end of life. [7]
Clinicians may generally have some understanding of what constitutes inappropriate care at the end
of life. [8] Treatments are considered medically inappropriate due to many factors: the intensity of
resource use deemed more substantial than warranted, [9] patients being too ill to benefit from
ICU management, [10] unnecessary treatments when there is no hope of surviving the ICU stay, [11]
the intervention is expected to have a negligible impact on recovery of independence, [8] or the
treatment having no bearing on the health outcome or quality of life of the person. [12] Yet doctors
still administer aggressive treatments to patients at the end of life, [13] even though recognition of
dying has occurred. [14] This may create confusion among patients’ and family’s understanding of
the expected trajectory. It is then not surprising that no consensus on the patient or family
perception of what constitute appropriate admission to ICU or appropriate treatment in an ICU are
available.

A first step in decision-making about continuing or suspending aggressive care implies the delivery
of negative prognostic information to families, [15] a practice that more often than not involves
spending more time speaking to families and less time listening to their concerns. [16, [17] The
central theme of these conversations is clarifying the treatments goals. That is, deciding whether
the aim of treatment is curative, palliative, or terminal depending on the expected response and
clinical outcomes and giving the patient or family opportunity to decline treatments if they so
wish. [18] Patients or families are often asked to participate in decisions to withdraw or withhold
treatment after a patient has been admitted to ICU [19, [20] but conflict over the end-of-life care
in ICU and strategies to resolve this conflict are still a concern. [21]
To our knowledge there has been no accepted definition of what intensivists agree is appropriate.
Limited research also appears to be available on the health service user perspective. [8, [22, [23]
Hence we conducted this review in an attempt to understand the concept and illustrate the
perception of inappropriateness of ICU treatments from the patient and family perspective when
there was no longer a true prospect of benefit for the patients but a possibility of treatment causing
more harm than good.
Specific objectives
This review aims to address the following questions:
1. To what extent are older patients and their families involved in decisions about appropriateness
of intensive care admission or treatments?
2. How do patients/families define inappropriate intensive care admission or treatments?

Methods
We searched for English language articles published from January 2001 to November 2017 in two
databases: Medline and PsycInfo. For details of the methods search, study types, eligibility criteria
and data extraction see Supplement 1.
Results
Thirteen publications produced over the past 16 years and covering 6,194 patients or surrogate
decision-makers addressed at least one of our research questions (Table 1). The eight quantitative,
four qualitative and one legal report from five countries (9 from USA, 2 from Canada, 1 Australia
and 1 from France-Hungary) mainly targeted surrogate decision-makers (10/13) but half (7/13) also
involved elderly patients themselves. We found only two studies directly offering the patient or
family definitions of or a perspective on inappropriateness of treatment at the end of life, [12, [24]
one study sought to determine if elderly patients were consulted before admission to ICU, [25]and
one study specifically addressing inappropriateness of care in ICU. [26] All other studies mostly
investigated satisfaction with end-of-life care or discordance between healthcare providers and
families about the need for or benefits of certain ICU procedures or treatments.
In the absence of a published definition in most studies, and due to the reported significant
association between inappropriateness and dissatisfaction with medical treatments in ICU
(p=0.0003) [26] we accepted dissatisfaction measurements as a proxy definition of appropriateness
from the health service user perspective. Search results and exclusions based on title and abstract
are presented in the PRISMA diagram (Supplement 1).

Patient/family definitions
The terms inappropriate or futile were generally not used in the reviewed studies but a recent
survey of ICU patients and their surrogates in the US and Hungary reported that “too much
treatment” was perceived inappropriate mainly due to misalignment with either patient or family
wishes, or because it caused unacceptable suffering, or was too costly. [26] A small fraction (5.4%)
of respondents deemed some ICU interventions inappropriate by this definition.
In a small US veteran’s clinic study, elderly outpatients defined futility as those treatments
administered when the patient “has nothing to look forward to”, or “is a vegetable”, or the
treatments are “a waste of time and money”. [12] Factors predisposing participants to categorise
end-of-life interventions as futile were a low likelihood of treatment success, a limited expected
effect on patient’s longevity and quality of life, and an anticipated emotional and financial cost to
the family. [12]
A smaller qualitative study also reported that families felt more in control if patients were admitted
to ICU where care, although traumatic, is more personalised and perceived to be of higher quality.
By contrast, palliative care was perceived as abandonment of patients or providing interventions to
hasten their death. [27] From this health service user perspective, survival was more important
than palliation and thus aggressive care in the ICU was paradoxically associated with higher levels
of surrogate satisfaction. [27] On the other hand, bereaved family members in a large retrospective
study of Medicare beneficiaries, were less likely to consider admission to an ICU within 30 days of
death for patients with advanced stage cancer as excellent quality of care. [28] This view was
associated with the place of death not being consistent with the patient’s wishes.

Extent of patient/family consultation
Consulting patients about their perceptions, values, fears, risks and preferences was not
commonplace (Table 3). Lack of consultation with patients or lack of control over decision on
treatment discontinuation by families (5/13 studies) or inadequate communication (4/13 studies)
were reported to cause dissatisfaction with ICU management (Table 2). The extent of satisfaction
with family involvement varied depending on the completeness of information given to them and
on the coverage of the priority issues in the communication.
While prognostic issues before admission to ICU should be discussed with health service users, [29,
[30] the role of initiating the end-of-life discussion or consultation on patient preferences for
transfer to IC may vary across health systems from the emergency physician on admission in some,
to the bioethics expert or the palliative care team during hospitalisation in others. [31, [32, [33]
These grey areas can sometimes have serious emotional and legal implications [34] as decisions are
usually carried out from a medical perspective. Discussion on preferences or rationale for ICU
admission can be affected by the patient’s mental competence to communicate preference; [25]
the predicament of doctors to witness the grief of relatives while balancing prognostic estimates
and decision making; [35] and the family preparedness to accept the inevitable without attempting
further care. [36] Other diverse factors contributing to communication failure regarding prognosis
are shown in Table 3.
Health care service user- provider discordance
Even after discussions on treatment goals take place, there is a risk that insufficient communication
can lead to conflict if prognosis, values, care preferences, and fears or concerns are not adequately

addressed. [37] Family disagreement with health professional advice, hereby assumed as
disagreement with the medical definition of inappropriateness, was reported in 5 publications. The
most commonly cited domain of patient dissatisfaction with (inappropriateness of) ICU treatment
was inconsistency with patient or family values (8/13 publications, Table 2). Refusal to accept
prognosis (4/13) and aggressive care causing suffering (4/13) were also reported as contributors of
dissatisfaction with ICU management. The least frequently reported reasons for dissatisfaction with
ICU treatments were high cost (2/13), presumable due to differential in funding arrangements
across health systems, where in some cases costs to the individual may not be relevant. Family
disagreements due to prolonged length of ICU stay or lack of understanding of the aim of limitations
of life-sustaining therapies were also rarely reported (1/13 each).
Overall in our review the main reasons for dissatisfaction with ICU care were inconsistency of
medical decisions and consumer values, poor understanding of the aims of life-sustaining therapy
and lack of acceptance of poor prognosis (Tables 2 and 3).
Discussion
The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU interventions at the end of life has had
limited attention in the medical and nursing literature, but the few studies found confirm that there
is a difference in the interpretation of inappropriateness between health service users and
healthcare providers. Actual definitions and reports of the extent of patient/family perceived
inappropriateness are scarce but based on the few articles found it is clear that inappropriateness
encompasses factors such as personal and religious beliefs, alignment with patient preferences and
values, quality of life post-intervention, treatment costs, and emotional impact.

The terms satisfaction with healthcare and quality of death are more often investigated, and usually
measured in terms of scores or scales.
Reported dissatisfaction with selected ICU treatments originated predominantly from the
discordance between medical decisions and consumer values rather than from lack of consultation.
Patient/caregivers were found to describe ‘inappropriate’ as not being consistent with their wishes,
whereas clinicians generally describe it from a knowledge-base where the delivered intensive
procedures exceeded expected benefit [38] does not match the patient’s poor prognosis or the
treatment has no impact on quality of remaining life. [39, [40, [41] As end-of-life decisions to
withdraw or withhold treatments from patients who cannot communicate for themselves, [42] are
usually delegated to surrogates who may be unaware of patients wishes and therefore request
futile treatments, [43] the discordance between the medical and family constructs reflects the
difference in that knowledge base. This dissonance may be the reason for the unrealistic
expectation by families that the purpose of ICU is to attempt everything including prolongation of
care and death with the advent of technology. [36]
It is acknowledged that some places may be conducting Intensive communication with ICU
patients and relatives and this has shown to be associated with lasting reductions in ICU length of
stay and reduced mortality in critically ill adult medical patients. [44] Yet there is no indication that
the practice is widespread. In some countries (including the USA, Australia and New Zealand)
doctors are not obliged to seek consent from surrogate decision-makers or patients to cease
inappropriate treatments. [45, [46] Instead they have long been considered to be in first line to
determine appropriateness or futility [47] as they are by default acting in the best interest of
patients. As such families do not have the legal right to insist on specific interventions. [34] In

many cases the urgency of the decision required can trample these good intentions if a prior end
of-life discussion has not been held. [25] The dilemma is that not arriving at a joint decision
contravenes the principle of patient autonomy, [12] but If the patient is incapacitated, the
autonomy cannot be delegated unless a family member who possesses the relevant legal right
through a power of Attorney to act in the patient’s best interest for health matters. [46, [48]
The growing demand for ICU admission for the very elderly and a need to respect patient autonomy,
[25] are acknowledged, as loss of self-determination is associated with perceived loss of control of
the dying process and corresponding loss of dignity. [49] The question emerging is whether there is
a point where a balance or satisfactory negotiation can be achieved on the extent of ICU care or
decision to admit to ICU without prolonging suffering and death. The ideal situation would be where
the decision is neither doctor-driven nor patient/surrogate-driven [45] but a reconciliation of the
two perspectives. Patient and family priorities such as number of available staff or ability to interact
with family while admitted to hospital may influence desirability of ward admission over ICU
admission, reflecting lack of understanding in general populations of the type of care required for
the level of illness severity. [50] Further, family involvement in critical decisions in ICU is known to
lead to psychological distress, anxiety and depression regardless of whether patients die or survive
the ICU admission. [51] Hence, consultations on appropriateness of ICU treatments for terminal
patients may be undertaken early to give families time to observe the deterioration and adjust to
the inevitable; [52] and detailed information provided with caution to certain subpopulations who
are not fully informed of the concepts of severity or the consequences of their involvement in
decision-making.
When there are discordant opinions between families and health professionals, decisions to admit
the dying elderly for short periods to trial care in ICU in an attempt to address the discordance. [53]

Page 12 of 29
This practice is motivated by prognostic uncertainty, the medicalisation of death and professional
fear of failure. [54, [55] Clinicians may advocate for these time-limited ICU intensive treatments
until prognosis is more certain or until differences of opinion within families are reconciled as
families realise the treatment goals need to change from curative to palliative. [53] Paternalism is
said to detract from the ethical obligation of involving families in ICU decisions [56] but lack of
consultation may reflect the nature of the ICU environment where patients are critically ill and
cannot be consulted and their surrogate decision-makers may not be present. [57] Is there an
alternative? Consultation before ICU admission, if feasible, could contribute to less dissatisfaction
as it is known that the timing of negative prognostic communication is associated with the
preparedness of families and the complexity of decision-making [15] While many families accept
recommendations for withdrawing or withholding treatment, [42] unreasonable expectation of
recovery still contributes to patient or family requests for medically inappropriate treatments. [24]
On the other hand, some relatives of patients on long dying trajectories only seek information and
reassurance rather than direct input into decisions whilst others prefer to only decide on treatment
goals and place of death rather than choose specific treatments. [58] For surrogates wanting an
honest prognosis and an involvement in decision-making, communication should go beyond the
passing of information [59] and into consultation and support.
A way forward
Given the domains considered in the reviewed studies, we suggest that the concept of
patient/family perceived inappropriateness of ICU admission or treatments should cover both the
medical and social constructs. That is, evidence of consultation, inclusion of patient values and
preferences, resolution of patient-physician discordance and measures of family satisfaction with
quality of death. If the main reasons for discontinuing treatments such as poor prognosis, perceived

non-beneficial therapies and patient preference, [60] were communicated to families before
admission and formalised in an advance care plan, [61] patients and families may be able to better
grasp the concept of inappropriateness and better fulfil their role in representing the patient’s best
interest.
It is feasible to interview or survey bereaved relatives and even patients in ICU about this topic and
more research is required into the trade-offs that the community will be willing to accept. Much
education on the difference between withdrawing, withholding, and allowing to die [62] is still
needed to improve public understanding of the role and implications of palliative and comfort care
and the potential inappropriateness of ICU admission. More importantly, education is also essential
to enhance medical and nursing understanding of these differences and prevent conflict within the
profession and between professionals and the public. In the face of some certainty of irreversibility,
the end-of-life transition in ICU is a coordinated effort and in the medical world orders for limitations
of life-sustaining treatment do not necessarily imply abandonment of patient care. [63] However,
when it is clear the treatment goals will not be achieved, prolonging life is a violation of ethical
principles [64].
Strategies that have been shown to reassure families of the appropriateness of the ICU treatments
and generate more satisfaction include: obtaining consent, [65] better step-by-step communication
updates as status and indications for treatment changes, sufficient time for information exchanges,
consistent information and knowing the role of each service provider. [66] While surviving the ICU
to discharge is heralded as a ‘success’ even if from the patient’s perspective, communicating the
expected long-term quality of life after ICU discharge may in theory assist families in making
informed decisions that match the patient’s personal values and treatment goals. [67] This

prognostic information is not usually disclosed (or known) by intensivists and extrapolation from
observational datasets may amount to ‘best guess’.
Health service user consultations in this review were short of proposals for strategies to negotiate
disagreements between the scientific and the belief-based sections of the community on the time
and the type of end-of-life interventions. Other gaps identified by us and others for future research
include: the perception by different decision-maker roles within a family; the rationale for
discordance with the treating team; investigation of variations in perception of inappropriateness
by socioeconomic level and across cultures; and evaluation of the effect of interventions to increase
listening by critical care clinicians.
Limitations
Most of the reviewed studies did not offer a definition inappropriateness from the patient/family
perspective or analysed the results by population subgroups such as ethnic minorities or various
health systems. Satisfaction with involvement in decision-making rather than its extent was
generally reported. This may have been due to our searches been limited to two major databases
(Medline and PsycInfo). The generalisability of the findings is limited by the few articles found,
publications predominantly from English speaking countries, and largely ethnically homogeneous
participants. It is possible that we missed some keyword in our online search but we also conducted
extensive manual searches of reference lists for eligible articles.
Implications for practice

carries the ethical dilemma of overlooking patient values and preferences. [68] In routine practice
it is feasible to consult families of critically ill patients or bereaved relatives [35] and it would be
useful to document patient/family preference for the balance between quality and quantity of life
and consult them on how this perception changes with age or progressive disability.
One role of the physician is to deliver prognostic news sensitively, help families accept the
imminence of death, involve families in decision-making when the patient is incapacitated, and co
ordinate healthcare providers in the effective application of end-of-life-care extending to limitations
of life-sustaining treatment. [69] This could be assisted by recognising and effectively using the
informal roles of family members as they emerge during crisis situations. These have been identified
as Primary Care Giver, Primary Decision Maker, Family Spokesperson, Out-of-Towner, Patient
Wishes Expert, Protector, Vulnerable Member, and Health Care Expert. [70] Consultation with them
can minimise conflict and facilitate negotiations on prevention of inappropriate ICU admission or
interventions.
The family conference or other approaches to joint decision-making are opportunities for
reconciling differences of opinion and for enhancing families understanding of the consequences of
inappropriate ICU care at the end of life. It is important to understand factors beyond religious
objections that make surrogate decision-makers disagree with medical recommendations and insist
on interventions when the chances of survival are extremely low or non-existent. Our findings on
what matters to patients and families can help design education or communication programs for
clinicians and families. For over two decades guidelines have stated that restricting ICU admission
for the elderly is unethical if the decision is made on the grounds of age. [25, [71] However,
limitations of life support are shown to be more acceptable for them and their families, [72] and
probably this debate needs to be reignited to include the prospects of recovery, functional

autonomy and quality of life the elderly patient will have following discharge. [25] Drawing the line
on medically inappropriate ICU care could start with discussions within the various treating
specialists about those elderly patients who have multiple factors for poor prognosis to reach
consensus on whether the time is right for withdrawing or withholding treatments. Conflict
resolution with families can involve compassionate approaches to managing requests for potentially
inappropriate treatments, understanding what the family hopes to achieve, and explaining realistic
expectations of the benefit of aggressive interventions. [32, [62]
Conclusions
Perceived inappropriateness of ICU treatments for families and patients is multifactorial and it
involves social constructs beyond the medical rationale. Health service users appreciate
consultation on their values and improved communication for shared decisions about ICU
admissions and treatments, but their definition of inappropriateness appears to clash with the goal
of-treatment orientation of the medical perspective. Discordance between healthcare provider and
health care user perceptions and satisfaction with end of life management in ICU continues to be a
consistent finding across studies. Much work lies ahead in clinicians’ understanding the family
experience and consulting families before ICU admission to reconcile these differences.

Table 3. Extent of family involvement and factors contributing to communication failures between healthcare providers and patients/families
Family/patient involvement Concept Extent Consultation about treatment goals and level of importance
• Infrequent addressing of treatment goals in discussions (1.4 – 31.7%) [37] • On average only 1-2 of 11 possible key elements were discussed in determining goals of care. [37] Importance as ranked by seriously ill patients: #1Being consulted about end-of-life care preferences and #2 being consulted about values. • Priorities as ranked by relatives: #1 being told about patient prognosis and #2 having an opportunity to express fears and concerns. [37] Completeness and consistency of information and time for questions. [72]
• Satisfaction with these aspects was significantly greater for relatives of patients aged >65 years.
Dissatisfaction with decisionmaking process
• Median satisfaction with own decision-making scores = 80 (IQR 62.5, 92.5) and median satisfaction with support for decision-making = 75 (IQR 50, 100). • Higher satisfaction for patients or relatives who had a certain level of control in the situation and involvement in the choice to withdraw life support. [73] Levels of concern with
physician’s communication
• Higher levels of concern with physician’s communication (27.8% vs. 15.3%) and higher needs for information (49.2% vs. 32.7%) among bereaved families of those who received more aggressive the end-of-life care. [74]
Lack of consultation with health service users
• One preparation and connectedness were significantly higher the older the patient was [25, [72] • Bereaved family satisfaction with communication, discussion on end-of-life matters, time for questions and quality of death was also higher. [72]
• Only 12.7% (range 1% to 53.6%) of patients were asked for their opinion before admission to ICU even when >80% of them were capable of expressing their opinion. [25] Reasons for lack of consultation
• Old age, absence of a relative at the time of the episode of care, dementia, frailty or severe functional impairment and poor nutritional status. Importantly, seniority of the medical
officer was inversely correlated with the probability of asking for the patient’s opinion. [25] • The uncertainty factor which is inherent in most medical decision making. [75] • The culture of setting treatment goals on the behalf of patients without discussing alternative care pathways before aggressive treatments are administered. [23, [76]

• The practice of patients or families simply accepting medical decisions on the desirability of ICU admission. [42]
Reasons for conflict with medical recommendation to treat or discontinue ICU treatments • Doubt about physician’s prediction; need to digest all information before accepting prognosis • Need to convince themselves of the irremediable situation. [24] • Difference of opinion on aggressive care. [26] • Reported even in the presence of patient advance care directives, both as a result of
surrogates’ poor understanding of the term “life-saving measures” or the family’s inability to accept poor prognosis. [77] • Timing of the discussion at moments of crisis when families require more time to prepare for the patient’s death before agreeing to treatment. [78] • Discontinuation of parenteral nutrition or mechanical ventilation sometimes can end in legal disputes, as the law does not require doctors to administer treatments they consider to be futile or to be “not good medical practice”. [34]
• Discordant religious beliefs between staff and families of critically ill patients. [64]

SUPPLEMENT 1 – DETAILS OF RAPID REVIEW METHODS
Data sources, eligibility and PICOS criteria
For articles targeting (P) older patients (aged 60 years and above) with advanced or terminal illness
admitted to ICU and/or their families or caregivers. (I) Anticipated articles for review were those
investigating any approaches or practices with evidence that the treating team disclosed details of
risks and benefits of treatment options and possible unexpected effects and/or consulted
family/patient perspective or preference on admission to ICU. They were included in the review if
they addressed at least one of our two research questions. (C) Comparator (if relevant) were patient
groups or settings where no discussion had been held on patient perspective on appropriateness of
admission to or treatment in ICU. (O) Outcomes of interest included but were not limited to:
• Proportions reporting involvement (opportunity) in decision to admit to ICU
• Proportions involved in/consulted on acceptability of ICU treatments
• Self-reported or proxy-reported appropriateness/desirability of ICU admission
• Family or patient satisfaction or regret with ICU admission or treatment
• Definitions of inappropriate from the patient or family viewpoint
(S) Study types eligible for this review were all qualitative or quantitative: Delphi studies, focus
groups, in-depth interviews, qualitative studies and systematic reviews of qualitative studies; and
quantitative studies such as cohort and cross-sectional surveys included only if the aim or outcomes
were perceived inappropriateness of ICU admission or treatment. The following were agreed for
exclusion: Case studies, duplicate studies, editorial articles unless they were literature reviews on
the topic, studies with a focus on clinicians’ perceived inappropriateness, and studies or outcomes
where inappropriate was defined as “too little” care.

Screening and data extraction
Searches were conducted simultaneously by two authors (SS and MC) and inclusion or exclusions
for all papers were assessed by one author (SS) and cross-checked by another (MC). Discrepancies
were discussed and resolved with the involvement of a third colleague with expertise in literature
reviews.
Search Strategy
Search terms as follows were eligible if included in title or abstract only:
“End of life OR Terminal OR Advanced chronic illness OR Dying” AND “Intensive care OR ICU”
AND “Patient preference OR Decision making OR Surrogate decision OR Treatment Options OR
Famil$” AND “Inappropriate$. OR Futil$ OR Non-beneficial OR Cost-ineffective OR Disproportionate
OR Perceived OR Satisfaction OR ICU Outcomes OR Survival OR mortality”.
