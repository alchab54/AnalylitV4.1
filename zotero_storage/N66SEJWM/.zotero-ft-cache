Abstract
Efficacious, effective and efficient communication between healthcare profes
sionals (HCP) and patients is essential to achieve a successful therapeutic alliance.
Telemedicine (TM) has been used for decades but during the COVID-19 pandemic its
use has become widespread. This position paper aims to describe the terminology and
most important forms of TM among HCP and patients and review the existing studies
on the uses of TM for asthma and allergy. Besides, the advantages and risks of TM are
discussed, concluding that TM application reduces costs and time for both, HCP and
patients, but cannot completely replace face-to-face visits for physical examinations
and certain tests that are critical in asthma and allergy. From an ethical point of view,
it is important to identify those involved in the TM process, ensure confidentiality
and use communication channels that fully guarantee the security of the information.
Unmet needs and directions for the future regarding implementation, data protection,
privacy regulations, methodology and efficacy are described.

1 | INTRODUCTION TO TELEMEDICINE
Telemedicine (TM) has been around in different forms since the end
of the last century. The rise of telecommunications began in the late
nineteenth century when tools for remote communications such as
the telephone, radio and telegraph were invented. More recognizable
elements of TM were seen by the 1950s when in two health centres
in Pennsylvania in the United States (US), telephone technology was
used to exchange radiologic images. One of the most famous examples
of TM occurred in 1999 when a physician Jerri Nielsen found a lump
in her breast while conducting research in Antarctica. The diagnosis
and treatment of her breast cancer were carried out over a distance
and the video equipment and chemotherapy were delivered by US Air
Force pilots.1–9 Patients' accessibility to remote medical services is ea-s
ier today than it has ever been. The severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic which exploded in 2020 drove
the broad use of TM because of necessary contact restriction mea
sures, affecting also health professionals. TM allowed for continuity of
care including professional exchange with and between medical advi
sors. TM is rapidly gaining acceptance as a convenient way of access
ing medical services worldwide.10 There will be an increasing value in
facilitating adoption of TM in the post-COVID era.11
1.1 | Definitions
TM as a term was first coined in the 1970s to describe ‘remote
healing’ (literally means ‘healing at a distance’).12 The World Health
Organization (WHO) define TM as ‘the provision of healthcare ser
vices, in which distance is a critical factor, by professionals who use
information and communication technologies (ICTs) to exchange
data to make diagnoses, recommend treatments and prevent dis
eases and accidents, as well as for the permanent training of health
care professionals (HCPs) and in research and evaluation activities,
in order to improve the health of people and the communities in
which they live’.13 In the European Union, TM is considered as the
provision of healthcare services, through the use of ICTs, in situa
tions where the health professional and the patient are not in the
same location, and it involves secure transmission of medical data
and information, through text, sound, images or other forms needed
for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients.14
As a leader in the promotion and support of TM and telehealth, the
American Telemedicine Association promotes the use of guidelines
that can be freely accessed and discussed.15
TM is a part of telehealth and they both are included in electronic
health (e-Health) (Figure 1). According to the common definition of
the WHO and the European Commission, e-Health refers to the com
bined use of electronic ICTs in the health sector to share, store and
retrieve electronic health data for prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
monitoring, educational and administrative purposes, both at the
local site or at a distance.16,17 The terms: TM and telehealth refer to
care that is only given at a distance. TM refers specifically to remote
clinical services. Telehealth is broader and can include not only re
mote non-clinical services, such as provider training, administrative
meetings and medical education but also clinical services. Although
the terms telehealth and TM are used interchangeably, they do not
have the same meaning. TM refers specifically to the practice of
medicine via remote means, with the help of technologies and tele
communication systems. Meanwhile, telehealth covers all compo
nents and activities of healthcare and the healthcare system that are
conducted through telecommunications technology. Healthcare ed
ucation, wearable devices that record and transmit vital signs and pr-o
vider-to-provider remote communication are examples of telehealth
activities and applications that extend beyond remote clinical care. As
noted above, telehealth has evolved to integrate a broader variety of
digital healthcare activities and services. A glossary of TM terms and
related definitions which appear in the text are summarized in Table 1.
The additional definitions of TM forms, services and medical
acts are presented below according to the European Parliament,
the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee,
the Committee of the Regions and the EU member states
legislation.14,18–21

separated healthcare providers (remote requests medical advice
from another professional regarding a certain medical issue is known
as teleexpertise) or between healthcare providers and patients with
the use of ICTs to communicate at a distance. The purpose of tel
econsultation is to diagnose or treat a patient at a remote site, to
obtain a specialist's second opinion and to develop innovative care
pathways. Teleconsultation is a good option for those who live in
rural and remote areas, where there is a lack of healthcare profes
sionals and for people with physical disabilities, who have increased
difficulties attending physical consultations. Teleconsultations help
save patients' time and transportation costs and can be done from
patient-friendly environment like home.14,18–21
1.2.2 | Teletriage
Teletriage refers to the process of identifying a patient's problem,
assessing the level of urgency and recommending advice via phone
by trained professionals, to guarantee a safe, timely and appropriate
disposition of patient symptoms. Rather than diagnosing symptoms
it has sense to estimate the urgency of care to safely direct the
patient in need (home or on-site treatment). Medical advisors are
trained and need to follow a list of predefined questions in order
to determine whether symptoms are life-threatening, emergent, ur
gent, acute or non-acute. Teletriage contributes to reducing health
care system costs through a reduction in inappropriate emergency
visits and is beneficial to patients as a tool to use under conditions of
urgency or uncertainty.14,18,19
1.2.3 | Telemonitoring
Medical telemonitoring is the remote control of various individual
parameters through wearables and biosensors, also referred to as
telesurveillance, when a healthcare professional makes remote inter
pretations of medical data with or without medical decisions for fol
low-up on the treatment of a patient. Telemonitoring-type services
are utilized in the context of the provision of medical care and provide

health professionals with the physiological parameters of the pa
tient/citizen by using ICTs. Telemonitoring offers various benefits: it
can improve the quality of life of chronically ill patients through self
management solutions; reducing hospitalization costs; and saving on
unnecessary emergency visits. Telemonitoring services, as opposed
to medical act-type services, usually do not involve physicians in the
first line of the service provision. Many telemonitoring services are
primarily managed by the nursing profession. Physicians must be in
volved when vital signs indicate a deterioration of the patient's con
dition. In this case, it becomes a medical act. Telemonitoring services
involve the management of alarms and comprise rule-based surveil 
lance schemes. Automated filtering of the primary data by computa
tional algorithms may avoid false alarms and sensory overload of the
health professionals in charge. Telemonitoring improves the quality
of medical care provided to chronically ill patients and reduces the
frequency and duration of hospital stays.14,18–21
Telemonitoring is not included in the curative scope of TM, but in
the telecare scope, focusing on the preventive aspect of healthcare.
According to Nangalia,18 the telemonitoring chain is composed of five
stages: (1) data acquisition using an appropriate sensor; (2) transmis
sion of these data from the patient to clinician; (3) integration of the
data with other data describing the state of the patient; (4) synthesis of
appropriate action, or response or escalation in the care of the patient
and associated decision support; and (5) data storage. Telemonitoring
services empower patients to actively manage their diseases, and at
the same time enhance continuity of care and prevention of future oc
currences in the context of chronic disease management.19
1.2.4 | Tele-education
Medical tele-education for patients, general population or HCP in
cludes online educational lectures, programs, scientific libraries and
databases, educational websites and virtual hospitals.19–21
1.2.5 | Teleassistance
Medical teleassistance is used when a healthcare professional pro
vides remote support or assistance to another professional in the
context of a medical act.18–21
1.2.6 | Telesurgery
Telesurgery refers to the use of TM equipment and ICTs to sup
port and monitor surgical procedures at a distance, or to perform
remote surgery with robotized computerized machines and devices,
for instance, patients with permanent rhinosinusitis with nasal pol
yps may undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery or a balloon
sinuplasty.22 This means that telesurgery can be performed using
two methods: telementoring or telepresence surgery/teleinterven
tion. The former consists of the remote interactive assistance given
by a specialist to a surgeon during a surgical procedure, through the
use of video and audio connection. The latter uses robotized and
computerized technologies to actively perform remote surgeries,
by linking surgeon's movements to a scale-down and very precise
movement produced by a small robot machine.18,19,21
1.2.7 | Telediagnosis
Telediagnosis is the determination of the nature of a patient's dis
ease, at a remote location, based on the clinical data and information
(i.e. data, images and video records) transmitted through ICTs.18,19,21
1.2.8 | Telerehabilitation
Telerehabilitation is the remote delivery of rehabilitation services
to the home or place of choice of the patient (also referred to as
e-rehabilitation).19
1.2.9 | Telescreening
Telescreening consists of the use of ICTs between patients and
healthcare providers to remotely identify a possible disease that
was not previously recognized in individuals without any signs or
symptoms, or with pre-symptomatic or unrecognized symptomatic
disease, through the use of medical tests that can also be provided
remotely. Automated analysis, coupled with digital stethoscopes, can
play a crucial role in enabling telescreening of severe lung diseases2.3
Understanding the different forms of TM and related services,
using the appropriate ones, and obtaining informed consent, doc
umented either as a written or verbal one, are important rules for
the implementation of a TM program for patients with allergies and
asthma.21 Specific forms of TM are summarized in Figure 2.
1.3 | Use of TM across disciplines
In the publication of Shigekawa,24 the authors researched system
atic reviews and meta-analyses published between January 2004
and May 2018 trying to answer two relevant questions: (1) does
the evidence indicate whether services delivered via telehealth are
equivalent to in-person services? and (2) does the evidence indicate
whether the use of telehealth services (remote monitoring, mobile
applications, structured phone disease management by nurses and
fully automated website interventions) affects the use of other ser
vices? Both paediatric and adult populations receiving a telehealth
intervention for any disease or condition were included. The authors
concluded that in most cases, telehealth appeared to be equivalent
to in-person care, but it is unclear whether the use of telehealth ser 
vices reduces the use of other services, duplicates services or im 
proves access to beneficial services.

The diagnostic accuracy of in-person clinic dermatology is better
than teledermatology, as the researchers showed. Diagnostic con 
cordance of store-and-forward (S&F) and clinic dermatology was
‘acceptable’/‘good’, but concordance rates were better for live video
and clinic dermatology although based on fewer patients. Overall
accuracy was equivalent between teledermatology and clinic der
matology. Evidence consistently supported teledermatology's ef
fectiveness in diagnostic and treatment concordance with in-person
dermatology.25 Some studies reported significant improvement in
physical functioning for telerehabilitation compared to usual care,
significant improvements in pain for telerehabilitation or no signif
icant differences between telerehabilitation and control groups.
Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Michelle Cottrell
and co-authors found that both real-time telerehabilitation and
usual care reduced pain and improved quality of life and physical,
psychological and social functioning, with a slight effect in favour of
telerehabilitation over usual care alone.26,27 Generally, when tele
consultation was used some studies found a significant decrease in
visits to general practitioners, but some found an increase in return
consultations following telephone consultation (the authors did not
report an increase in adverse events or emergency visits associ 
ated with telephone consultation).28,29 The authors reported that
teleconsultations resulted in more repeated visits but required pro
viders to spend less total time with patients.30
1.4 | Use of TM in allergic and asthma patients ́ treatment
In chronic diseases such as asthma and allergy, TM offers value in
both treatment and monitoring, as it is detailed subsequently in the
manuscript. In summary, TM has shown valuable cost-effectiveness,
suitability, convenient synchronous and asynchronous monitoring
of the diagnosis and or treatment of allergic conditions, especially
in vulnerable and remote patients. The study by Waibel et al. re
ported that 76% of allergic patients seen initially in person were
subsequently referred for a TM visit while 93.5% of patients seen in
itially by TM continued being seen by TM via follow-up phone calls.
Prescriptions were the same regardless of how the patients were
seen.31 Both new and follow-up visits to the allergist/immunologist
were well received by patients and demonstrated significant indirect
cost savings, with less than one-fourth of the patients recommended
for an in-person visit. Moreover, the authors estimated that of 112
TM visits, 200 work days or school days were saved and $58,000
in travel-related costs and 80,000 km in driving was avoided. In a
different publication by Portnoy et al.,32 the researchers compared
asthma control in 100 children seen in person with 69 who were
seen via TM—asthma control (measured by the Asthma Control
TestTM) improved in both groups. The clinical differences were not
present for patients seen in these two ways and therefore asthma
care over distance is comparable to care delivered in person. Asthma
management in the school setting, which included administration of
preventive medications and TM encounters with primary care pro
viders, produced significantly better outcomes than asthma man
agement via traditional in-person methods.
In another study enrolling 400 children, those in the intervention
group had more symptom-free days per 2 weeks (11.6 vs. 10.97; dif
ference, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.15–1.22; p = .01) and showed to have lower
probability to visit an emergency department (ED) or hospitalization
(7 vs. 15% odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.84) for asthma.33 The
study suggested that TM was an efficient way to link children to pri
mary care and facilitate asthma assessment and treatment. Moreover,
clinical and cost-effectiveness of mobile phone-supported self-mon
itoring of asthma with a multicentre randomized controlled trial on
288 adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma was as
sessed. In this study, patients in the control (paper) group were asked
to keep a paper diary, recording the same data as the intervention
(mobile monitoring) group (symptoms, drug use and peak flow read
ings) twice daily. Both groups were provided with the same clinical
care. The researchers found no significant difference between mo
bile technology asthma control and paper monitoring based on clin 
ical guidelines. Also, cost-effectiveness was assessed with regards
TM for the delivery of outpatient pulmonary care to a rural popula
tion, which one study demonstrated that can be more cost-effective
($335 per patient/year) compared with usual care (about $585 per

patient/year) and on-site care ($1166 per patient/year).s.34,35 In the
same line of remote monitoring, Australian researchers studied an
asynchronous form of TM using remote monitoring of symptoms and
the use of an asthma action plan in 72 pregnant women. The inter
vention group used a handheld device connected to a smartphone to
measure lung function along with a written asthma action plan while
the other group received usual care. After 6 months, the TM group
experienced improved asthma control and improved asthma-related
quality of life when compared to the control group. The two groups
did not differ in lung function, number of acute healthcare visits,
missed work/school or amount of oral corticosteroid used.36
Although skin prick testing with aeroallergens and food extracts
are not recommended to be performed at distance in TM visits, the
usefulness of TM with digitized grid reconstruction was very recently
discussed to improve the value of photo assessment in late patch
test readings.37 Moreover, a 2018 study concluded that TM can be
used to remove penicillin allergy suspicion (‘delabelling’),38 saving
the patient time and monetary expenses (over $30,000). The money
saved was calculated by the authors by reducing the use of vanco
mycin, metronidazole, aztreonam, aminoglycosides and clindamycin.
Besides, the authors showed that the average total time to complete
an in-person consultation was 128 min (standard deviation [SD] ±33).
Of this, the average physician assistant travel time was 46 min (36%)
with the remaining time spent on clinical services (82 min, 64%). The
average physician telemedicine time per patient was 5 min (SD ±2).
2 | TELEMEDICINE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS
There are few main delivery models used for TM service 39 (Figure 3).
2.1 | Store-and-forward (asynchronous)
Store-and-forward (S&F) TM is also called asynchronous TM and al
lows the exchange of pre-recorded healthcare data between two or
more individuals at different times. It also permits deferred commu
nication between patients and health professionals. Computerized
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, x-rays, photos, videos
and text-based patient data are gathered and sent to specialists
and other members of a care team to evaluate patients and assist
in their treatment. Technologies used for the S&F TM include se
cure servers and routers that temporarily house incoming packets
of information and then route them to the appropriate end users.
Secure e-mail platforms are also often used for S&F TM, as it is
an inexpensive and easy to set up choice.40 In the field of allergy,
this model could be used for sending photos of skin lesions with a
relevant clinical history to a healthcare professional working in a
remote health facility.
2.2 | Live videoconferencing (real-time or synchronous)
Real-time (or synchronous) TM requires the immediate transmis
sion of information through a communication device to allow real
time interaction between a patient/healthcare professional and
a healthcare provider/specialist, who are simultaneously present,
but remotely. Synchronous TM is considered interactive and live.
It includes videoconference tools for audio and visual examination.
Devices for remote physical examination, such as electronic stetho
scopes, can be used. Usually, it is done through video-conference
equipment, but a phone call or an online chat forum are also interac
tive forms of synchronous communication. Live videoconferencing
is a good choice for controlling the status of asthma through pa
tients' regular short remote visits with the physician.
Another type of a live (synchronous) TM visit is a facilitated vir 
tual visit (FVV). An example of FVV occurs when the patient is lo
cated at an accessible site (i.e. clinic) where diagnostic equipment is
available and the medical provider is at a distant site. A telefacilita
tor (i.e. medical assistant, nurse) gathers objective measures using
equipment (i.e. digital stethoscope, thermometer, pulse oximeter,
other) and transmits this data to the provider.39,41,42

SMOLINSKA et al.
2.3 | Remote patient monitoring
Remote patient monitoring (RPM) involves the reporting, collection,
transmission and evaluation of patient health data through electronic
devices such as wearables, mobile devices, smartphone apps and
internet-enabled computers (Figure 4). RPM technologies remind
patients to weigh themselves, check vital signs like blood pressure,
oxygen levels and transmit the measurements to their physicians.
RPM helps with continuous evaluation of a patient's clinical status
via review of parameters, tests and images collected remotely. The
transmission of collected data can be done on a regular basis every
few days for example. Newer technologies, such as mobile applica 
tions on devices, allow for a wider breadth of telehealth possibilities.
In allergic patients, this could possibly work for registration of daily
allergic symptoms in patients' e-diaries.32,39,41
2.4 | m-Health
Applications designed to be installed on mobile devices (or handheld
computers) such as smartphones or tablets which allow patients to
get in touch with a medical advisor anytime and anywhere are an
integrated function in mobile health (m-Health). These applications
allow patients to track health measurements, set medication and ap
pointment reminders and share information with clinicians. Users
can access hundreds of m-Health applications including asthma
and diabetes management tools as well as weight loss or smoking
cessation applications. Digital inhaler devices could become an in
tegral part of the management of asthma via telemedicine. These
devices are equipped with wifi and/or bluetooth capabilities to up
load inhaler use and other data to a cloud accessible to the patient's
healthcare provider.43 This would provide real time assessment of a
patient's adherence and inhaler technique. Additionally, mobile de 
vices allow users to schedule appointments and communicate with
providers via video conference and text message.32,39,41
3 | ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TELEMEDICINE
The list of benefits and disadvantages of TM are shown in Table 2.
3.1 | Advantages of TM for patients and HCP
TM can successfully help patients with a range of medical con 
ditions. Providing safe care during the COVID-19 pandemic was
challenging, but beneficial from many points of view. 44–46 TM al 
lows easier and faster access to care for people who are geograph-i
cally isolated, those who are incarcerated, patients with disabilities
and other groups, including elderly populations. TM services need
to be creative and active in promoting equality, non-discrimina 
tion and human rights. Some research revealed that TM reduces
healthcare disparities for patients in remote locations. 21,47,48 The
use of TM allows the patient to contact the preferred HCP regard
less of geographical distance, thus allowing specialist opinion con 
sultations in a simple manner, without having to face (sometimes
long) journeys. TM allows patients to access healthcare from the
F I G U R E 4 Wearables (adapted from Alvarez-Perea A et al.59).

safety, comfort and privacy of their own homes and this can also
lead to reduced healthcare costs. 42 Some researchers suggested
that patients using TM spend less time in the hospital, with cost
savings.34,49,50 E-visits (electronic visits) have significantly lowered
costs compared with face-to-face visits, reducing trips to hospitals,
time off-work and childcare costs.39,51 Recently researchers sug
gested a role for TM in preventing unnecessary emergency and
hospital utilization following disasters, such as natural disasters,
war and extreme remote sites.52–54
3.2 | Advantages of TM for allergic patients
TM interventions may apply to different allergic and immune dis
eases, including allergic rhinitis and asthma, drug and food allergies
or atopic dermatitis.55,56 Besides conducting new and control visits
remotely, TM allows risk assessments, avoidance of hospitalization,
patient and family education and improved therapeutical sup 
port.46,57 Moreover, TM is useful for allergy services in rural and re
gional locations lacking specialty services.58 By facilitating access to
specialists, TM is valuable especially for allergic patients whose con
dition requires prompt assessment, a need often hindered by long
waiting lists.3 TM has been used mostly in patients with asthma. 59
The first report was published two decades ago and revealed im
provement in asthma symptoms and quality of life in paediatric
patients through specialty care delivered via TM. 60 Several stud
ies subsequently demonstrated how using short message service
(SMS),61 internet-based systems62 and providing patient education
to patients using real-time TM63 improve asthma outcomes, with
comparable results to in-person visits.32 TM may be also used to
de-label previously considered penicillin-allergic patients, providing
high satisfaction rates in patients,59 by skin testing performed by a
trained allergy/immunology physician assistant with subsequent TM
video consultation performed by an allergist.38 TM may be used to
evaluate seasonal allergy symptoms, especially at the beginning of
the spring pollination season, which may resemble the common cold
and sometimes COVID-19. Children are at lower risk for COVID-19
and have a less severe course of the disease, but vulnerable patients
with immunodeficiency, representing a potential at-risk group, are
recommended to be consulted via TM.64 Given the actual rates of
vaccine hesitancy, TM is also used to address vaccination barriers by
providing accurate information about vaccine efficacy, schedule and
timing and safety profile.65–67
3.3 | Advantages of TM for healthcare professionals
An important use of TM is in triaging patients with a referral to the
allergist to determine the need for in vivo and/or in vitro allergy
tests, for pre-assessment of specialized treatments such as allergen
immunotherapy or biologics, for pharmacotherapeutic education
and follow-up to monitor treatment response and adverse effects.68
It is possible also to pay less for front desk support and/or reduced
office spaces. Thus, HCP who offer TM services may incur fewer
overhead costs. Through TM, HCP can expand their catchment area
regardless of geographic distance and save time and money which
normally would be used for travels between workplaces. TM can
lead to decreased HCPs burnout, improved compensation and flex 
ibility in patient management.21 By consulting patients remotely,
HCPs are not at risk of exposure to airborne pathogens from these
subjects. TM visits reduce the need for personal protective equip
ment (PPE) use.69,70 The majority of specialists with qualifications
in allergology perceive TM implementation as positive during a

pandemic and can imagine integrating TM services into their daily
clinical routine in the future.71
As TM is more and more accepted, it is necessary to incorporate
a standardized telehealth curriculum in Allergy/Immunology fellow
ship training.72
3.4 | Disadvantages of TM for patients
When using TM, there are several disadvantages and potential con 
cerns both for patients and HCPs. TM was not a convenient fit for
all patients or circumstances. An increase in TM consultations was
insufficient to fully replace the reduction in face-to-face consulta 
tions during the COVID-19 pandemic.67 Moreover, there is concern
that the use of certain technologies depersonalizes the patient–cli 
nician relationship.39 Another issue previously reported consists of
overprescribed antibiotics in patients assessed by TM consultations
for respiratory tract infections.59,73
TM requires technology and an adequate internet connection.
Some disadvantages are related to the so-called ‘digital divide’ rep
resenting the disparate access to and utilization of technology and
the Internet among communities and populations of diverse race/
ethnicity and socioeconomic demographics due to social, language,
financial and other barriers.74
TM is particularly beneficial in rural and underserved communi
ties, but ensuring reliable access to ethnic minority groups in rural
areas is necessary. Fortunately, broadband online access is still
needed only in a few regions.55
Additionally, patients speaking less-represented languages or ex
periencing intersecting literacy barriers are underserved with TM.
Existing TM platforms need language interpreter services, sometimes
as a third party, in order to be optimized for diverse patient support7.5
Being unable to have a physical examination completed is a major
disadvantage of TM. Moreover, when a patient needs emergency
care, accessing TM first may delay treatment, particularly as a doc
tor cannot provide lifesaving care. In addition, the fact that in vivo
allergy procedures such as skin tests, immunotherapy injections and
oral challenges cannot be done by TM, and the lack of in-person
communication/inability to optimize physician/patient relationship
represent other important disadvantages.76
Older age, greater limitations in physical capacity and cognitive/
sensory impairments are other disadvantageous factors for TM,
along with low socioeconomic status and the lack of technology ac 
cess or comfort.77
Some researchers suggested that an aggravation of inequities
may be an unintended consequence due to factors having roots in
different forms of discrimination, such as racism, ageism and ableism,
and their intersections.78,79 According to the American Geriatrics
Society, we all are able to identify communities where not only age
ism but also ableism and other forms of discrimination impact differ
ent means of healthcare access.63 Moreover, a recent observational
cohort study during a COVID-19 pandemic peak in New York City,
found that there are multiple groups that experience disparities in
TM access and subsequent aspects of care. For instance, African
Americans and those with a lower mean income and higher average
household size were less likely to use TM to seek care. The multilevel
nature of observed disparities indicates that complex interventions
at different levels are needed.64
3.5 | Disadvantages of TM for allergic patients
Although general recommendations suggest the continuation of
allergen immunotherapy and biological therapy, the discontinua
tion rate is significant in some countries.9,80–83 Websites offering
episodic on-demand care may disrupt the continuity of healthcare
between the patient and the allergist and undermine care coordi
nation. In-person consultations are a preferred option for severe
allergic conditions. It is possible to proactively discuss modified
management of anaphylaxis via TM,66 but emergency department
care is needed if a patient has had severe anaphylaxis episodes in
the past.84 Although TM evaluations rely on patient self-reports and
comprehensive health history taken by the healthcare provider, limi 
tations regarding the lack of physical evaluation are obvious 59 and of
importance in many allergic diseases. Some specific cases where in
person appointment is irreplaceable include skin prick tests, blood
tests, contact dermatitis epicutaneous tests and allergen challenges.
Large-scale studies of patient outcomes comparing in-person ver
sus TM visits are needed.42 The management of asthma patients
requires regular lung function testing, importantly spirometry. The
diagnostic and prognostic value of these tests is well established,
and they are recommended by all existing guidelines to diagnose and
monitor asthma patients (adults and children). The initial diagnosis
of asthma requires a face-to-face visit of the patient to the clinic to
perform a bronchodilator test, FeNO measurement, methacholine
challenge, etc. The subsequent monitoring can be done through TM,
as long as the patient is instructed and uses regular ambulatory PEF
measurement. In case of worsening, TM can help triage patients who
need to come to the clinic for further functional evaluation.81
A home-monitoring mHealth system was used in asthmatic pa
tients in research settings, consisting of a portable mini-spirometer,
together with a fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) home-mea
suring device with audiovisual control of correct performance, a
wearable device to measure the respiratory rate (RR), a physical ac
tivity tracker, a smart inhaler adapter, an indoor air-quality monitor
and a smartphone app, used along with asthma control and quality of
life questionnaires and outdoor air quality online maps. The smart i-n
haler device recorded information on compliance with regular treat
ment and the need for reliever medications.85,86
A smartwatch/smartphone combination serving as a hub for per
sonal/wearable sensing devices collecting data on health, such as
mobile spirometry and asthma medications and personal exposures
was also recently used within a biomedical evaluation platform.87
Moreover, a new speech-based spirometry has the potential to
eliminate the need for an additional device to carry out lung function
assessment outside clinical settings.88

3.6 | Disadvantages of TM for healthcare professionals
Those who offer TM services may also face some associated draw
backs. Choosing the optimal digital platform for TM can be chal
lenging. Allergists must ensure that the TM platform used is secure
and compliant with privacy laws. In some countries, other concerns
regarding the quality of TM services are related to outdated tech
nology systems, computer viruses or hardware failures, network
crashes linked to power outages and online access/wireless issues
such as limited high-speed broadband internet connectivity in some
medical establishments, poor audio and/or video quality.21,89
Important disadvantages of TM for HCP are represented by lia
bility issues and the need to be licensed in the state where the pa
tient is located, and possibly to be credentialed in a local hospital.
Significant disadvantages are the concerns about reimbursement,
including the fact that the reimbursement may be not adequate in
some jurisdictions or TM services are performed while patients are
overseas, and the lack of in-person communication/inability to opti
mize physician/patient relationship.76
Some of the key medicolegal implications of TM include licensing
and jurisdiction, failure to provide an appropriate standard of care,
documentation and not adhering to privacy and security regulations.
Patients who engage in TM while at work or multitasking, while driv 
ing, exercising or having concomitant childcare responsibilities may
not be able to provide their full attention or accurate medical inform-a
tion. Therefore, clinicians should assess the patient's ability to engage
in a meaningful medical discussion and provide informed consent.90,91
3.7 | TM impact on doctor–patient relationship
In the face-to-face HCP-patients relationship, communication is stra
tegic and is based on the professional's situation awareness or rather
on his or her degree of awareness of the communicative scenario.
This competence is particularly relevant in the relationship mediated
by technology, characterized by important nuances with respect to
the face-to-face relationship. Table 3 details the main differences
between face-to-face communication and online communication.92
4 | SUMMARY: UNMET NEEDS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE
4.1 | Unmet needs regarding TM implementation in Europe
Despite the gradual global implementation of TM for more than a
decade, restrictive administrative regulations and the lack of solid
legal frameworks slowed down the growth of this remote clinical
service. In Europe, TM is considered both a health service (Directive
2011/24/EU) and an information service (Directive 95/46/EU,
Directive 2000/31/EC, and Directive 2002/58/EC), but due to lack
of pan-European uniform medical liability and medical legislative
regulations, a Europe-wide TM framework is not realized. There is
not sufficient governmental support for TM innovation and coopera
tion between European countries to implement TM models.93 There
is a great need for a standardized lexicon, methods and guidelines
for TM in Europe. There are still many barriers for TM to become
accessible to every European patient and to be fully covered by all
social security systems. Many different legal and regulatory aspects
regarding TM across Europe are associated with various other dif
ficulties in defining a European standard of care for TM.90,94
4.2 | Unmet needs regarding data protection and privacy regulations for telemedicine
With the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), effective data protection in TM became critical. There is
a need for more preventing data protection failure mechanisms by
better managing the risk of unauthorized access, establishing cyber
hygiene routines in practice, managing the risk of device theft, loss
and sharing, building more trust with patients and reducing data pro
tection concerns. Secure and legally compliant exchange of data in
TM can be achieved if the legal basis for data protection is clear and
known, the creation and structure of the data protection policy are
achieved and the data protection concept is audited and regularly
evaluated to ensure the security of patient data and to regulate data
flows, data storage and data processing.95,96
4.3 | Unmet needs regarding TM methodology and efficacy
Large-scale studies of patient outcomes assessing TM versus in
person visits are needed. In addition, the methods by which TM vis
its can most effectively be integrated into a clinical practice must
be clearly defined, along with guidelines developed for individual
specialties. Moreover, there is still a need to convince payers and
legislators that TM services should be reimbursed just like any other
medical encounter and without excessive regulations. This is some
times not easy, the long-term effects of TM on healthcare costs and
patient outcomes are not currently precisely established.15,42 Box 1
presents the barriers for TM development.
5 | CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTION IN TM
Specific TM guidelines, concrete legal and regulatory aspects, ven 
dors who provide standardized and legally compliant systems as
well as insurance and governance support are on the actual list of
needs for proper and further TM development. Mobile technolo 
gies are increasingly used by more and more patients, and TM
will evolve. The new generation of wireless telecommunication

technologies also opens new possibilities as well as demands. 5G is
technology characterized mainly by Gigabits per second, speed of
enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low-latency communi 
cations and massive machine-type communications with a huge im
pact on TM. 5G is not a single technology, rather it is a combination
of cutting-edge technologies, including big data, cloud computing
and artificial intelligence.97–100 Despite many arguments support 
ing TM as a healthcare tool, it still should not replace fully face-to
face models but, rather, continue to be used in parallel, depending
on need.
