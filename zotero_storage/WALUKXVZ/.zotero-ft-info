Title:          A standardized surgical approach to appendiceal orifice tumors: a case report
Subject:        AcademicSubjects/MED00910, DOI: 10.1093/jscr/rjaf259, Journal of Surgical Case Reports, 5, 00, 22 4 2025. Abstract: The optimal management of appendiceal orifice (AO) tumors remains a topic of debate due to their anatomical complexity and the absence of a standardized surgical approach. This case report describes the successful treatment of an incompletely resected sessile serrated lesion at the AO in a 47-year-old female using a multidisciplinary strategy. Preoperative imaging, gastroenterology consultation, and intraoperative specimen evaluation guided a laparoscopic appendectomy with cecal cuff resection, achieving complete tumor removal with minimal morbidity. This approach preserved ileocecal valve function and ensured accurate pathological assessment. This case highlights key considerations, including the importance of avoiding ileocecal valve compromise and ensuring polyp retrieval for definitive pathological assessment. We propose appendectomy with cecal cuff resection as a standardized, effective technique to reduce treatment variability and mitigate incomplete resection risks in AO tumors.
