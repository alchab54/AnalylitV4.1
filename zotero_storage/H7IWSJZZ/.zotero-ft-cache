Abstract
In recent years the development of new virtual environments has been qualitatively
high and fast at the same time, but the dissemination of virtual reality (VR) in clinical
practice is still scarce. The aim of this review is to give an insight into the state of the
art of the use of VR as an assessment tool and treatment intervention in anxiety and
related disorders as posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive–compulsive
disorders.
Besides an overview into the efficacy of VR, a summary will be given on assumed
working mechanisms in virtual reality exposure therapy and how this aligns with
current theoretical models. Further, it will be discussed how VR is accepted by
patients and research into the reluctance of therapist to use this technology
during treatment with focus on the therapeutic alliance and how it may be
influenced by the use of VR. Finally, we discuss clinical and future issues as, for
example, dissemination into clinical practice and what VR has to offer therapists
in future. This not only in adult population but as well in younger patients, as
young adolescents VR has a great potential as it connects easily with its playful
elements to this population and might be a low threshold step to offer treatment
or preventive interventions.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Exposure therapy involves exposing the patient to feared stimuli and
is the treatment of choice in the majority of anxiety and related
disorders (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2011).
Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) can be categorized as a
modern variant of exposure therapy designed to simulate naturalistic
environments wherein patients are exposed to their idiosyncratic fear.
Given its unlimited technological possibilities, VRET offers the
therapist a pallet of options to provide individual tailored exposure
treatment. The use of VRET in anxiety and related disorders has been
one of first technological agents introduced in the therapist's office.
Its efficacy has been studied extensively (e.g., Carl et al., 2019;
Wechsler et al., 2019), including its generalizability to the real world
(Morina, Ijntema, et al., 2015).
The dominant theory in explaining the effects of exposure ther
apy has been the Emotional Processing Theory (Foa & Kozak, 1986).
However, in recent years the effects of exposure therapy have been
explained in terms of the inhibitory learning model (Craske
et al., 2014). Although underlying mechanisms of VRET are still not

well understood (Scheveneels et al., 2019), parallels in temporal
precedence between VRET and exposure in vivo have been found
(Meyerbroeker et al., 2013).
The aim of this literature overview is to provide the reader with
the current evidence for VR as an assessment and treatment tool in
anxiety and related disorders. We will further focus on implications
for future research and clinical practice.
2 | ASSESSMENT
VR offers a high potential in ecological validity and controlled real life
experiences (Bell et al., 2020). Furthermore, consumer and commercial
VR has been available for a long time now (Riva & Serino, 2020).
Nonetheless, empirical findings about VR as an assessment tool
are still scarce. Most of the available research into the assessment of
anxiety disorders with VR has been conducted with social
anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). For a more extensive overview
in other disorders see Emmelkamp and Meyerbröker (2021).
2.1 | Social anxiety disorder
Research investigating whether VR can be used as a reliable and valid
assessment tool in SAD and fear of public speaking has produced
rather inconclusive results. This might be due to the racing
technological development in recent years. While in earlier years
spontaneous interaction between the patient and an avatar (virtual
person in VR) were not possible due to pre-programmed speech
sequences of the avatars, more recently spontaneous interaction in
VR were made possible by developing interactive avatars.
Several studies have concluded that virtual social environments
can be effectively modified for therapeutic purposes (Felnhofer
et al., 2019; Hartanto et al., 2014; H. Kim et al., 2018; Kishimoto &
Ding, 2019; Lange & Pauli, 2019). For example, Kim et al. (2018)
instructed 79 individuals with SAD and 51 healthy control participant
to give impromptu speeches on self-related topics to a virtual
audience and reported that participants with SAD showed less eye
gaze towards the audience than healthy controls. Lange and
Pauli (2019) examined avoidance behaviour in 50 individuals with high
versus low social anxiety and concluded that avoidance behaviour
when bypassing virtual humans with neutral and angry facial
expressions is modulated by the emotional facial expressions of virtual
bystanders and that social anxiety generally amplifies avoidance.
Research has also investigated the use of verbal interactions
between individuals with high anxiety levels and virtual humans. In a
pilot study with healthy participants, it was found that real time
conversations operated by the therapist in VR can elicit fear
(Powers et al., 2013). Our group has applied a virtual reality system
specifically designed to expose clients with social anxiety to anxiety
provoking verbal social situations. In a study, we found that two
sessions of virtual exposure involving several free speech dialogues
with avatars prearranged by the therapist could induce significant
levels of social anxiety in university students with elevated social
anxiety (Morina, Brinkman, et al., 2015). In a more recent study, we
investigated whether a VR behavioural avoidance test (BAT) would
predict social anxiety in daily life (Kampmann et al., 2018). In
particular, we investigated the value of maximum anxiety levels during
in vivo and virtual reality behavioural assessment tasks (BATs) in
predicting daily social anxiety relative to self-report measures. It was
found that neither in vivo nor VR BATs better predicted complaints of
social anxiety than self-report questionnaires.
Other studies have investigated potential physiological
differences between virtual reality BAT and in vivo BAT (Dechant
et al., 2017; Kothgassner et al., 2016; Owens & Beidel, 2015;
Scheveneels et al., 2019). The findings indicate that asking individuals
with and without SAD to give a presentation in front of a virtual
audience versus a real audience leads to similar significant increases in
physiological outcomes, such as salivary cortisol, cardiovascular
or electrodermal activity (Kothgassner et al., 2016; Owens &
Beidel, 2015). This applied both to normal participants and individuals
with SAD. There is some preliminary evidence that assessing
physiological outcomes while being confronted with feared virtual
environments may have diagnostic validity (Scheveneels et al., 2019).
In sum, VR has the potential to function as an ecological valid
assessment instrument. However, future research needs to further
examine its potential additional value above self-report questionnaires.
2.2 | Posttraumatic stress disorder
Even though patients with PTSD are known to be highly avoidant of
trauma related stimuli, research into VR as an assessment tool is scarce.
In one study conducted with veterans, it was investigated whether
avoidant behaviour on an avatar task predicts PTSD severity (Myers
et al., 2016). In this study, the patient directed an avatar confronted with
elements potentially triggering his symptoms. A strong correlation
between PTSD symptom burden and the ability to predict PTSD symp
tom burden based on demographic variables (age, sex and combat expo
sure) was significantly improved by adding the task score as a predictor.
The authors concluded that virtual environments have the potential for
more objective assessment of PTSD symptoms, compared with symptom
self-report which have been associated with over- or underreport of

symptoms in veterans. In PTSD research, VR has been used as a predic
tion tool for the development of PTSD symptoms in veterans as well, for
an overview see Bourla et al. (2018). Furthermore, VR has also been
applied as an experimental psychopathology model to study trauma
related symptoms among healthy participants. Several studies provide
evidence that VR can successfully elicit negative affect and
induction-related symptoms (e.g., Cuperus et al., 2017; Dibbets, 2020;
Dibbets & Schulte-Ostermann, 2015; Meyer et al., n.d.). The aim in these
studies is to assess relevant cognitive, behavioural and physiological pro
cesses involved in stress-related symptoms, aiming at increasing our
knowledge about PTSD by modelling processes related to trauma
exposure.
2.3 | Obsessive–compulsive disorder
In OCD, several studies have investigated the feasibility of VR as an
assessment instrument, mainly focusing on evoking fear of
contamination and control behaviours. Objective behavioural indices
have been used to study OCD behaviour in a daily environment
(e.g., house and office) to assess how individuals engage in OCD rele
vant tasks (Kim et al., 2010). The VR task included measures of
checking behaviour (i.e., frequency and gaze duration) and time spent
gazing at relevant OCD stimuli. It was found that these measures
differentiated well between healthy individuals and those with OCD. A
study elaborating on these findings by the same group (Kim et al., 2012)
investigated whether the VR environment could discriminate OCD
patients with checking behaviours from those without checking behav
iours. The authors concluded that patients with checking behaviour
showed a higher checking frequency and spent more time on checking
and more time on gazing in the VR environment. This is in line with a
pilot study done by another group, wherein a virtual video game envi
ronment (i.e., a house with different OCD provoking situations as, e.g., a
burning gas stove) was used to provoke more OCD symptoms in OCD
patients in comparison to healthy controls (van Bennekom et al., 2017).
The study was replicated in another small sample by the same group
(van Bennekom et al., 2021). No relation was found between arousal
and emotions during the VR game and the severity measure of OCD.
The authors concluded that their gaming environment has the potential
to objectify and standardize OCD diagnosis. In a study focusing more
on individuals with fear of contamination, a subtype of OCD, it was
investigated whether the VR environment could evoke anxiety
symptoms (Laforest, Bouchard, Crétu, et al., 2016). Participants had to
go through the restroom with various degrees of cleanliness (e.g., the
first stall was relatively clean, and the last presented filthy walls and an
unflushed toilet). Participants were asked to virtually ‘touch’ walls and
the toilet seat each time with their hands. It was found that exposure to
a more contaminated virtual environment resulted in higher levels of
anxiety on self-report and physiological measures in the OCD group rel
ative to individuals without fear of contamination.
In sum, it has been found that VR has potential in diagnostic valid
ity, including discrimination between subtypes of OCD (e.g., fear of
contamination). Yet, future research needs to further examine several
basic assessment criteria: usability; utility (i.e., what us the additional
value of a technological contribution), and satisfaction and reliability
(including accuracy, effectiveness, and efficiency) (for an overview see
Ferreri et al., 2019). Other relevant developmental possibilities con
cern for example enhancing the sense of presence by using rubber
hands in fear of contamination (Jalal et al., 2020).
3 | TREATMENT
Several clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of VRET for patients
with specific phobias, SAD, agoraphobia and panic disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and PTSD, and OCD.
3.1 | Specific phobias
Specific phobias can be subdivided into different categories such as sit
uational phobias (e.g. fear of flying) or small animals (e.g., spider phobia)
(American Psychiatric Association, (APA), 2013). We will limit this
overview to the clinically most relevant phobias as acrophobia and fear
of flying for which several RCT's have been conducted. In a first RCT,
33 patients with acrophobia were randomized to either VRET or
exposure in vivo to heights (Emmelkamp et al., 2002). The virtual
environments were an exact copy of the surroundings for the exposure
in vivo (i.e., fire escape stairs). VRET was found to be as effective as
exposure in vivo on anxiety and avoidance self-report measures and a
behavioural avoidance test. Results were maintained at 6-month
follow-up. In another study, a randomized crossover design was used
to investigate whether cognitive coping statements would enhance the
effects of VRET (Krijn, Emmelkamp, Ólafsson, Schuemie, & Van Der
Mast, 2007). Twenty-six patients with acrophobia were randomly
assigned to either two sessions of VRET followed by two sessions of
VRET + coping statements or two sessions of VRET + coping
statements followed by two sessions of VRET. The authors concluded
that coping statements had no additional value above VRET.
In a more recent trial that combined VR with a smartphone
application (Donker et al., 2019), participants with acrophobia were ran
domly assigned to either a self-guided app-based VR intervention using
cardboard VR goggles or a waiting list control condition. A total of six
animated VR CBT modules and a gamified VR environment were made
accessible during a 3-week period. A total of 193 participants were ran
domly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 96) or a control
group (n = 97). Intent-to-treat analyses showed a significant reduction
of acrophobia symptoms after treatment and at 3-month follow-up.
Another RCT was investigated whether effects of VRET in patients
with acrophobia or fear of flying could be enhanced by pharmacological
agents (Meyerbröker et al., 2018). Patients were randomly assigned to
either VRET plus yohimbine hydrochloride, VRET plus propranolol, or
VRET plus a placebo. It was found that while all three conditions
improved on the anxiety symptoms, no differences were found
between conditions, indicating that VRET with a nonactive placebo is a
powerful intervention in the treatment of acrophobia.

Research into the efficacy of VRET in fear of flying has been done in
comparison with different control conditions. In the first trials, it was
found that VRET for fear of flying was more effective than bibliotherapy,
relaxation and exposure in vitro (Maltby et al., 2002; Mühlberger
et al., 2001). The long-term effects were maintained up to 3 years after
treatment (Mühlberger et al., 2006; Wiederhold & Wiederhold, 2003). In
other trials, VRET was compared to cognitive therapy (Krijn, Emmelkamp,
Ólafsson, Bouwman, et al., 2007) and exposure in vivo (Rothbaum
et al., 2000; Rothbaum et al., 2006). It was found across studies that
VRET was as effective as exposure in vivo and that its effects generalized
to the real world (Morina, Ijntema, et al., 2015). VRET for fear of flying
offers some advantages over exposure in vivo. Along treatment efficacy
VRET for fear of flying represents a more sustainable therapy as it can be
conducted without having to actually fly (Meyerbröker, 2014).
3.2 | Social anxiety disorder
Several controlled trials have examined treatment efficacy in SAD
(see Emmelkamp et al., 2020 for an overview of research into differ
ent aspects of SAD). The first trial was conducted by Klinger
et al. (2005) who divided and matched 36 patients with SAD into two
groups based on gender, age, duration, SAD severity and ability to use
computers. The examination of a 12 sessions virtual exposure to
diverse social situations relative to a 12 sessions group cognitive
behaviour therapy revealed both treatments were similarly effective.
More recently, four RCTS have investigated VRET in socially anxious
patients, including speech anxiety. Bouchard et al. (2011) compared
two variants of CBT plus exposure with waiting list control: (a) CBT
plus exposure in vivo and (b) CBT plus exposure in virtuo. Both
variants of CBT were clearly more effective than the control condition
and no differences were found in effects of CBT plus exposure in vivo
and CBT plus exposure in virtuo. However, results are difficult to
interpret, given that the exposure variants were mixed with other
CBT exercises. Since then, three RCTs applying VRET alone or in
combination with cognitive components have been conducted
(Anderson et al., 2013; Bouchard et al., 2011; Kampmann et al., 2016).
Bouchard et al. (2011) compared CBT plus VRET (n = 17) and CBT
plus in vivo exposure (n = 22) to a wait-list condition (n = 20). Both
active treatments were more effective than wait-list and results indi
cated that CBT plus VRET was more effective than CBT plus in vivo
exposure. The results were similar at the 6-month follow-up. It must be
noted, however, that in this trial the therapist discussed exposure exer
cises with the patient while being in the same room, which may have
confounded the results. Furthermore, given the combination of cogni
tive restructuring and VRET, the effects of pure VRET cannot be iso
lated. Anderson et al. (2013) randomly assigned patients with SAD to
8 weeks of VRET (n = 30) or exposure group therapy (n = 39) or wait
list control (n = 28). A substantial number of participants had fear of
public speaking as their main complaint. Both treatments involved cogni
tive components addressing self-focused attention, negative perception
of self and others, rumination, perception of negative emotion regula
tion and unrealistic goal settings in social situations. Treatment efficacy
was re-assessed among 28 out of the original sample of 65 patients 4 to
6 years after treatment and the majority of patients reported significant
improvements (Anderson et al., 2017; Richards et al., 2016).
Our group (Kampmann et al., 2016) conducted the first trial with
patients with generalized SAD using pure VRET without any cognitive
intervention (n = 20) and compared this to individual exposure in vivo
without any cognitive intervention (n = 20) and a wait-list control group
(n = 20). Furthermore, this was the first trial to apply a variety of com
plex virtual social interactions (e.g., buying and returning clothes, talking
to a stranger or attending a job interview), which were controlled by the
therapist sitting in a separate room. Both active treatments were more
effective than the wait-list control group on social anxiety symptoms,
BAT, stress, and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs. However,
in vivo exposure was more effective than VRET in reducing social anxi
ety and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs at 3-month follow
up. Thus, VRET as a standalone therapy consisting of extensive verbal
interaction only was effective in reducing complaints of generalized
SAD, yet it was less effective than exposure in vivo.
Altogether, existing trials suggest that VRET for SAD is effective.
However, more clinical trials on the efficacy of VRET for SAD are
clearly needed.
3.3 | Agoraphobia and panic disorder
In the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia, VR provides an
excellent opportunity to mimic different daily life situations. Although
this prospect seems obvious, existing research into the efficacy of
VRET in panic disorder and agoraphobia has been limited, and
dissemination into clinical practice is not seen often.
In a first study with patients with panic disorder VRET was
compared to exposure in vivo in weekly treatment consisting of
nine sessions (Botella et al., 2007). It was found that VRET was
superior to the waiting list control group, but that effects for VRET
were comparable to those in exposure in vivo and were maintained
at 12-month follow up. In another study VRET was compared to
CBT in an 11 session treatment (Penate et al., 2008). At post
treatment participants were asked to do a behavioural avoidance
test, wherein patients were asked to walk on a common street.
Results showed that effects of CBT and VRET were comparable,
showing a significant decrease on panic measures. In another RCT,
92 patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia were randomized
to receive either CBT or VRET (Pelissolo et al., 2012). Moderate
response rates to treatment were found in both groups, without
any significant difference between-groups. The results were stable
at 9-month follow-up. In another RCT, our group combined VRET
with cognitive interventions and compared to cognitive interven
tions and exposure in vivo or a waiting list control condition
(Meyerbroeker et al., 2013). It was found that cognitive interven
tions plus VRET or exposure in vivo were superior to waiting list
control condition, but on three of the four outcome measures
effects found were equally effective between in vivo or VRET. In a
small RCT, the additional effect of cognitive therapy added to VRET

was investigated (Malbos et al., 2013) and no additional value of
cognitive therapy was found.
Taken together, VRET seems to be a suitable treatment for
patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia (Wechsler et al., 2019),
but dissemination is not easy in times that generalization and
distribution of virtual environments remains a costly issue.
3.4 | Generalized anxiety disorder
Different strategies have been applied to use VR techniques in the
treatment of GAD (see e.g., Wang et al., 2019). Not all of these
treatment approaches are in line with international treatment
guidelines (NICE, 2013), nor do they make use of standardized
research procedures or relevant clinical measures.
In a first study VRET was combined with a mobile device giving bio
feedback in comparison with a waiting list control group (Gorini &
Riva, 2008). In this small trial participants entered a relaxing and peace
ful virtual environment (e.g., a beach or a park), where they could relax.
After the relaxation phase participants were exposed to their idiosyn
cratic stressor in words and had to rate their anxiety. It was found that
both groups improved compared to baseline, but no differences
between the groups were found. These results are in line with another
study wherein VR was used as a relaxation method in combination with
a mindfulness skills training (Navarro-Haro et al., 2019). In this study
mindfulness group training was compared with mindfulness training
plus VR training in mindfulness in reducing GAD symptoms. It was
found that both groups improved significantly on GAD measures, but
only the VR group showed a better treatment adherence.
In a small pilot study, 24 patients with GAD were randomized to
(a) the VR and mobile group, including a biofeedback-assisted
relaxation programme; (b) the VR and mobile group without
biofeedback; or (c) a waiting-list control group (Repetto et al., 2013).
A clinical protocol for the treatment of GAD based on the use of a
biofeedback-enhanced VR system was investigated. The VR consisted
of an eight-session treatment wherein relaxation and exposure
techniques were used. In the first six sessions, patients explored
relaxing VR environments (e.g., a tropical island) that were
accompanied by progressive muscle relaxation. In the last two
sessions, the patients explored the island again but were exposed to
preselected words or images related to their idiosyncratic stressful
fears. Although both active treatment groups experienced a significant
decrease on general anxiety symptoms, no difference was found
between conditions.
In a different approach to treat GAD, it was investigated whether
the engagement in aerobic exercise would lead to stress reduction
and therefore to the presence of less GAD symptoms (Wang
et al., 2020). In this study 77 patients with GAD were randomly
assigned to either to virtual nature group or a virtual abstract painting
group. In the virtual nature a 20-min moderate to high intensity
aerobic exercise was done. Results on psychophysiological and
self-report measures showed that the virtual nature group compared
to the virtual abstract painting group showed higher levels of stress
reduction and personal satisfaction. The authors conclude that a
virtual exercise is more effective in inducing relaxing effects in
patients with GAD.
In within-subjects design it was investigated whether patients
with GAD, who were first exposed to a neutral non-catastrophic sce
nario and then to a personalized scenario in imagination or a standard
ized virtual scenario, all presented in a counter-balanced order
(Guitard et al., 2019). It was found that the standardized virtual reality
scenario evoked as much anxiety as the personalized scenario in imag
ination. The authors conclude that the standardized VR scenario can
be used in therapy and that the findings were not attributable to gen
eral negative effect but GAD anxiety specific.
In sum, there are interesting approaches into the treatment of
GAD, but none of these studies has proven the additional value of
VR in the treatment of GAD. The last study (Guitard et al., 2019)
seems to be a promising approach, but further efficacy trials
are needed.
3.5 | Posttraumatic stress disorder
Rothbaum et al. (2001) conducted the first examination of the efficacy
of VRET for PTSD in an open clinical trial with 16 male Vietnam
veterans in the US. VRET consisted of an average of 13 exposure
therapy sessions, following which patients reported a significant
reduction in PTSD. Since then, several RCTs have compared the
efficacy of VRET for PTSD, with most of them using exposure therapy
as an active control condition (McLay et al., 2011, McLay et al., 2017;
Reger et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2014), whereas one RCT compared
VRET to present-centred therapy. All of the trials comparing VRET to
an active condition were conducted with military personnel. The
findings do not suggest any significant differences between VRET
and exposure therapy (McLay et al., 2011, McLay et al., 2017;
Reger et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2014). The comparison of VRET to
present-centred therapy also indicated that VRET is effective in
treating PTSD, without any significant difference between the two
active conditions (Ready et al., 2010).
A number of RCTs compared the efficacy of VRET to wait-list
among military personnel (Gamito et al., 2010; Miyahira et al., 2012;
Reger et al., 2016) or civilians and disaster workers exposed to 9/11
terrorist attacks (Difede et al., 2007). These trials revealed that VRET
is significantly more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms than
wait-list control conditions.
Altogether, current research on VRET for PTSD suggests
that VRET can successfully reduce PTSD symptoms. It must be
noted, however, that the findings must be interpreted with
great caution because only two of the trials included more than
10 participants in the VRET condition (McLay et al., 2017; Reger
et al., 2016, with 36 and 30 participants in the VRET condition at
post-treatment, respectively). To that effect, more trials with larger
samples are needed. Furthermore, future research needs to
investigate potential benefits of VRET over other available
efficacious treatments.

3.6 | Obsessive–compulsive disorder
In a pilot study with OCD patients with fear of contamination, a
12 session VR exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment
was given (Laforest, Bouchard, Bossé, et al., 2016). A single-case
design was used to analyse the data of three patients exposed to two
different virtual environments (one neutral training environment and a
contaminated OCD environment). Data of a time series analyses
showed significant symptom reduction in all patients.
After this first promising pilot study, only two other trials into the
efficacy of VR ERP have been published. The first concerns a
nonclinical trial with participants (n = 21) with high fear of contamina
tion, who received three sessions of VR ERP (Inozu et al., 2020). It
was shown that participants experienced less anxiety and disgust and
a reduced urge to wash their hands in comparison with healthy
controls. In another study with OCD patients, the use of rubber hands
to simulate contamination with a patient's own hands were investi
gated (Jalal et al., 2020). In this trial participants watched a visible fake
hand that was mimicked with their invisible real hand, simulation
exposure to that their hand was contaminated with fake faeces.
Patients (n = 29) were randomly assigned to either synchronously
manipulation or asynchronously. It was found that after 5 min of
tactile stimulation of the hand no differences between groups were
found, indicating an increased facial disgust, increased anxiety and
handwashing urges.
To sum up, it is surprising that despite a chronic course of the
disorder, almost no studies into the efficacy of VR ERP can be found.
Although, different OCD themes (e.g., control, contamination, etc.)
make different environments necessary to apply broad ERP, these
themes seem to be universal (Hunt, 2020). Whether virtual
environments specifically need to incorporate all idiosyncratic fears of
patients remains unclear (Meyerbröker, 2014), however, the efficacy
of VR ERP still needs to be demonstrated.
4 | WORKING MECHANISMS OF VIRTUAL REALITY EXPOSURE THERAPY
In this section, the theoretical assumptions of exposure therapy and
how they align with findings within VR research will be discussed. In
general, research into the working mechanisms of change underlying
VRET has been scarce.
It has been assumed that the effects of VRET are driven by the
same underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms as exposure
in vivo. Currently, the most influential theoretical model on explaining
the effects of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is the inhibitory
learning model (Craske et al., 2014). However, according to the
inhibitory learning model, patients learn in exposure therapy that their
feared negative outcomes cannot occur or will not have the same
consequences as in real life. For instance, a patient with OCD will
know that touching a virtual contaminated toilet can lead to disgust,
but not to actual contamination. In fact, a large number of feared
negative outcomes often reported by patients with anxiety disorders
cannot occur in VRET. Therefore, it can be questioned if the effects
found in VRET can be fully explained by the inhibitory learning model.
In a recent study into the working mechanisms of VRET, it was
found that treatment effects were not predicted by the extent to
which participants could test and evaluate their expectancies of an
exposure task (Scheveneels et al., 2019). This remains the only study
to date, which investigated the effects of VRET and how these align
to the inhibitory learning model.
In earlier studies, the effects of VRET were investigated in terms
of the Emotional Processing Theory (EPT), which posits three basic
assumptions (Foa & Kozak, 1986). According to the EPT, first
activation of the anxiety network has to take place, before within
and between session habituation can occur. In VRET results with
patients with fear of heights (Emmelkamp et al., 2002), panic
disorder and agoraphobia (Meyerbroeker et al., 2013), and PTSD
(Reger et al., 2019) have been compared to exposure in vivo and
prolonged exposure. In fear of heights, the authors found that
subjective units of distress (SUDS) during VR exposure and exposure
in vivo showed that patients were basically experiencing the same
reactions: anxiety first increased during exposure and then steadily
decreased across sessions. The authors concluded that generally the
overall anxiety level experienced during VR exposure, was lower than
the anxiety experienced during exposure in vivo, but this did not
affect efficacy. This is comparable with the results found in panic
disorder and agoraphobia and PTSD and prolonged exposure. No
differences between the VRET and (prolonged) exposure (in vivo)
group were found on average and peak SUDS and relevant outcome
measures.
Besides the EPT and the inhibitory learning model, other
cognitive and emotional processes such as self-efficacy have been
investigated. Self-efficacy refers to the concept of trust into
one's own capacity to successful execute a relevant behaviour
(Bandura, 1977). Several studies have investigated cognitive and
emotional mechanisms involved in VRET. Both in SAD
(Kampmann et al., 2019) and in specific phobias (Meyerbröker &
Emmelkamp, 2008) it was found that self-efficacy increases during
VRET. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with treatment
outcome, but these changes did not significantly predict symptom
improvement (Kampmann et al., 2019).
In a study using VRET as exposure method in 28 patients with
spider phobia, it was found that changes in perceived self-efficacy
and dysfunctional beliefs were the best predictor of change in
general outcome measures (Côté & Bouchard, 2009). Findings
indicate that eventually a sense of mastery is an important element
accounting for the effects of VRET. A study done by the same
group (Tardif et al., 2019) revealed that among patients with spider
phobia changes in their beliefs about spiders and in perceived
self-efficacy significantly predicted the reduction in fear after VR
treatment.
In sum, it can be concluded that self-efficacy plays an important
role in VRET, possibly by breaking an avoidance behaviour pattern
and increasing the belief about one's own capacity and maybe thereby
the motivation in patients to go further in the process of exposure.

However, more research into the mechanisms of change in VRET is
clearly warranted, given that the effects of VRET do not align with
theoretical models.
5 | CLINICAL PRACTICE
With respect to clinical practice, there are some reoccurring issues
concerning both the patients and the therapists. Difficulties on how
to engage patients to use VR for therapeutic reasons relate to
patients' distrust in technology or avoidance tendencies. On the other
hand, some therapists are concerned that the use of VR might
diminish the therapeutic relationship. In our experience, most patients
are willing to at least give VRET a try. This helps them to get familiar
with the advantages of VR therapy. In recent years, the equipment for
VR treatment has become much lighter and easily applicable. In a first
study done already in 2007 (Garcia-Palacios et al., 2007) patients
willingness to undergo VRET or exposure in vivo was compared in
patients with specific phobias. The authors conclude that the
acceptability of VRET was comparable to exposure in vivo. In another
study the acceptability of VR interoceptive exposure was compared
to traditional interoceptive exposure in patients with panic disorder
(Quero et al., 2014). Although the VR interoceptive exposure was
evaluated as positively as traditional interoceptive exposure at
post-treatment, at 3 month follow-up patients who had received VR
interoceptive exposure were less satisfied than patients who had
received traditional interoceptive exposure.
While in the past decennia there have been enormous improve
ments of virtual environments, it has not been observed that patients
experienced significantly more emotional involvement by a higher
sense of presence. As a consequence, it can be concluded that making
virtual environments more realistic does not necessarily increase the
sense of presence and emotional involvement. Altogether, it seems
sufficient that a virtual environment generally contains the anxiety
specific triggers for a disorder to enhance the sense of presence in
patients. This is often enhanced when a certain level of interaction is
possible in the virtual environment. Comparing attrition rates between
VRET and exposure in vivo, it has been found in a meta-analysis
(Benbow & Anderson, 2019) that in anxiety disorders these attrition
rates are comparable.
With respect to the concern raised by some therapists that VRET
might interfere with the therapeutic alliance, we would like to point
out that VR therapy can of course be only partially used. This enables
the therapist to test the extent to which VR therapy interferes with
the therapeutic alliance. More importantly, several studies have
investigated the working alliance during VRET. In a study by Wrzesien
and colleagues (Wrzesien et al., 2013) no negative influence of VR
was found on the therapeutic alliance. In another study, a direct
comparison between VRET and exposure in vivo was made and no
differences in evaluation of the therapeutic alliance were found
(Ngai et al., 2015).
In conclusion, there is evidence that restraint in using VR in a
therapeutic context, is not supported by empirical evidence. In fact,
there is evidence that it produces comparable therapeutic effects
when adequately personalized to a patient's anxiety.
6 | FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Virtual reality provides clinicians with an enormous potential of
possibilities for therapeutic use and researchers with the option to
make use of highly standardized exposure procedures. There are a
few important aspects concerning the use of VR in the future. One
aspect that has been barely investigated is the use of VR in children
and adolescents within the therapeutic context. VRET is a potentially
fruitful approach to exposure, and particularly in adolescents, given
its low barriers and playful elements. Connecting with the
technological driven environment of adolescents, VRET is assumed to
have a high potential to improve treatment, early intervention and
prevention in this population. However, despite its potential in
adolescents, high-quality research on the effectiveness of VRET in
this group is scarce (Kothgassner & Felnhofer, 2020). There is only
one study in adolescents (13–16 years) with fear of public speaking
(Kahlon et al., 2019), that found that symptoms decreased
significantly and that treatment effects were maintained at 1 and
3 month follow up. One of the limitations of the study is that it did
not include an adequate control condition. In conclusion, whereas
VRET seems a promising treatment for adolescents with SAD, there is
a compelling need for high-quality research into its efficacy this
younger population.
One of the potentials but also pitfalls of VR is the proliferation
of different health technology companies offering different
functionalities within their commercial packages. Often these
packages have been developed by technicians and they miss the
important functionality as interaction or specific anxiety triggers.
Large differences in quality of therapeutical use and functionality
are all presented as virtual reality. Often it only concerns 360
video's with no potential for the therapist to give direction to the
intervention and no potential for the patient to interact. When
applications are provided with functionalities like these, develop
mental and economic costs increase enormously and this is not
always evident for clinicians as is always indicated that the
economic costs of VR hardware are being significantly reduced.
This is one of the potential obstacles concerning the slow going
dissemination of VR in clinical practice. Although the costs for the
hardware have been significantly reduced in the past decennia and
a VR computer set and VR goggles and one motion-sensing device
are available for less than $1.500 (Vailati Riboni et al., 2020) the
costs are mainly in developing and creating adequate VR
environments and functionality. These costs may be one of reasons
why dissemination of VR in clinical practice is still going slow
(Segal et al., 2011).
