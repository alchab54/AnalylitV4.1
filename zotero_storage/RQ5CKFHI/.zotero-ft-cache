Remote-Delivered Services During COVID-19: A Mixed-Methods
Survey of College Counseling Center Clinicians
Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically increased use of remote
delivered mental health services. This study identifies advantages and limitations
of remote-delivered services on college campuses to inform mental health
delivery post-pandemic. Methods: Clinicians (n = 30) were asked to evaluate
COVID-19’s impact on their work, environment, and wellness in an online
survey. Qualitative data was coded using a thematic analysis approach, while
quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Many
clinicians reported benefits of remote services, including increased accessibility,
greater convenience, no change in therapeutic alliance, and decreased stress for
clinicians. Clinicians also experienced challenges such as social isolation,
technological difficulties, and personal/family concerns. Clinicians envisioned a
hybrid service combining online and in-person activities post-pandemic.
Conclusions: Overall, remote-delivered mental health services on college
campuses have potential in increasing treatment quality while highlighting a
necessity for further research in hybrid mental health delivery.
Keywords: College students, mental health, clinicians, telehealth, technology,
COVID-19
Introduction
Mental health service utilization has increased over the last decade on college campuses
such that college counseling centers often suffer from long waitlists and a shortage of
providers.1 Both college students and college counseling clinicians have recognized in
previous research studies that delivering mental health support resources to students
outside of typical face-to-face services could help to address these concerns.2
Remote-delivered services may offer multiple benefits compared to in-person
services and increase the ability of clinicians to offer mental health services to
individuals who need them. Previous research indicates that mental health clinicians
recognize the potential for remote-delivered services to increase access to care, offer


2
flexibility in scheduling, and reduce costs for patients.3 Yet prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, mental health clinicians delivered approximately seven percent of their
services remotely.4 This lack of uptake may be related to clinicians’ perceptions of the
barriers to delivering services remotely. In an online survey conducted prior to the
pandemic, clinicians reported concerns around privacy, building rapport, and remote
crisis management.3 Additionally, while multiple clinical trials have established the
efficacy of remote-delivered services, there is little research examining the provision of
such services in routine clinical practice.5,6
In response to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, mental health providers
quickly shifted to delivering nearly eighty-five percent of their services remotely during
the pandemic.4 This shift to mostly online-delivered services offered an unanticipated
opportunity to build on previous research examining nontraditional service delivery.
Many researchers have suggested that this shift will ultimately improve mental health
service delivery, as it will allow clinicians and researchers to re-evaluate how to provide
services that are both accessible and scalable.7
The switch to remote-delivered mental health services is especially crucial to
investigate on college campuses, where students report multiple barriers to receiving
mental health services, including long waitlists, inaccessible locations, and limited
office hours.2 Such challenges to obtain services may pose risks to student well-being as
mental health concerns often go untreated. Many health and academic benefits of
counseling service utilization have been cited in previous research studies such as
improved retention rates and wellbeing, emphasizing the growing need for accessible
mental health care on college campuses.8-10
This need for mental health services was exacerbated during the COVID-19
pandemic, as college students reported rising rates of distress and more difficulty


3
accessing mental health services.11-13 These rising concerns around student mental
health during the lockdown were met through a shift to remote-delivered services on
college campuses across the nation, offering an opportunity to examine clinicians’
perceptions of the benefits and limitations of providing remote services to college
students.
This shift additionally offered an unprecedented opportunity to examine how
remote-delivery could impact staff wellness and clinician burnout. Burnout among
mental health clinicians is historically high and can lead to adverse outcomes such as
physical and mental health concerns, job dissatisfaction, negative attitudes towards
clients, and high staff turnover.14,15 During the pandemic mental health professionals
face heightened risk of experiencing increased workload, stress and job demands, and
lack of confidence in delivering remote services, yet it remains unknown how remote
work impacted clinicians’ wellbeing during the pandemic.16 Therefore, more research is
needed to understand clinicians’ experiences delivering remote telehealth services
during COVID-19 and the impact it had on their personal wellness and job satisfaction.
Understanding college counseling center clinicians’ perceptions of telehealth
delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to the future of college student
mental health service delivery. The adoption of telehealth services post-pandemic will
likely be impacted by how clinicians viewed treatment efficacy, accessibility, and staff
wellness during the pandemic. While previous research has examined clinician attitudes
towards delivering telehealth, the authors are not aware of any studies that have
investigated college counseling center clinicians’ attitudes towards remote-delivered
services or the perceived challenges and benefits of delivering remote services during
the COVID-19 pandemic.17,18 In fact, few studies prior to the onset of the pandemic
have looked at telehealth services on college campuses. While there has been limited


4
evidence to show the acceptability of telehealth services by college students and mental
health providers, further research is needed. This study aims to bridge this gap by
examining the benefits, challenges, and acceptability of remote-delivered services
among campus counseling clinicians and their willingness to engage in remote
delivered services post-pandemic.19
Methods
Participants
We used data collected from clinical staff members employed at college counseling
centers during July and August of 2020. A total of 30 clinicians from six college
counseling centers (ranging from community colleges to four-year colleges and
universities) in the Midwest region of the United States participated in the survey. There
was a wide variety in the size of colleges and universities - the largest institution
represented serves more than 20,000 students per year while the smallest institution
represented serves less than 2,000 students per year.
The study team first reached out to the directors of the counseling centers at
local schools to invite their staff to participate in the study. After the directors agreed to
participate, the clinicians from their staff were recruited via email and presentations at
staff meetings. Email addresses were used to verify clinicians’ employment status. All
study procedures were approved by the authors’ Institutional Review Board before
enrolling participants.
Survey
Clinicians were asked to complete an online survey hosted on REDCap that was
designed by study staff at Northwestern University. The survey asked clinicians


5
questions regarding demographics, the impact of COVID-19 on their experiences in
working with students, on their work environment, and on their personal and social
wellness, as well as suggestions for future changes in the counseling center workflow as
a result of COVID-19. These questions were structured in two formats: multiple choice
questions (e.g., “Are students more or less likely to show up for sessions when sessions
are delivered remotely?”) and open-ended questions (e.g., “If you had initial fears about
switching to remote delivered services, what were those fears?”). The full item list is
included in Supplementary Materials.
Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample and summarize
answers to multiple choice questions. Qualitative data collected from open-ended
questions were coded by authors using a thematic analysis approach.20 Qualitative data
was examined both by counseling center and in aggregate. There were no notable
differences in the responses of participants by counseling center, so qualitative data
analyses were conducted in aggregate. Coders first reviewed the data for thematic
content and created a codebook with the primary themes that they identified. After the
codebook was created, coders reviewed the transcripts a second time to ensure the
accuracy of the codebook and complete a final round of coding. The coders met
regularly throughout the analytic process to discuss these codes and ensure validity.
Results
Participant Characteristics
A total of 10 college counseling center directors were invited to have their staff
participate in this study, and 6 college counseling center directors agreed to have their


6
center participate. Response rates within counseling centers ranged from 35% to 100%.
There was a total of 30 participants between the ages of 29 and 65 (M = 44.22, SD =
9.63). The majority of participants indicated their gender was “female” (76.7%) with the
remainder indicating their gender was “male.” The sample was predominantly white
(80%) and non-Hispanic (90%). Participants held a variety of job titles, including
psychologists (60%), social workers (20%), psychiatrists (3.3%), and “other” job titles
(16.70%). Job titles listed under “other” included “clinical counselor” and “crisis
manager.” Participants had been working at their college counseling centers between
0.5 and 18 years (M = 6.38, SD = 4.27).
Theme 1: Benefits and Challenges of Clinicians Working from Home
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated that clinicians work from their homes, providing
remote-delivered mental health services. Clinicians were asked about how working
from home impacted work-related stress, job satisfaction, and productivity. There was a
considerable lack of consensus among clinicians, with multiple clinicians disagreeing
over whether they saw increases, decreases, or a lack of change in these areas (see Table
1). Overall, however, slightly more clinicians felt that work-related stress had
decreased, job satisfaction had increased, and productivity had increased.
Qualitative results helped to clarify why certain clinicians may have felt
dissimilarly about working from home depending on personal differences such as
family life, health conditions, or technological equipment. Clinicians identified
multiple benefits and limitations of working from home (see summary in Table 2).
Benefits
Many clinicians noted that because they no longer had to commute to work, they saved
money and had more free time. Participant 10 commented, “I get more sleep/am better


7
rested because I can skip the commute. It's nice to spend less on gas.” Participant 14
suggested that not commuting has helped them be able to rise to the increased demand
of pandemic era work: “I feel like there has been so much to do, that if I had to
commute as well I could not have gotten it all done.” No longer commuting to work was
especially beneficial to clinicians who had chronic health concerns, as Participant 3
explained:
“I have chronic health issues and being at home has increased my flexibility and
decreased the amount of time I am out sick... It is often difficult for me to
physically move and being able to work from home allows me to meet with clients
without having to go out, drive, go up stairs, etc.”
Similarly, some clinicians reported that their balance between work and personal
activities had improved because of their ability to take more breaks, multitask, or spend
time with family members while working from home. Participant 10 commented, “I like
being able to move/walk around during phone sessions. My work/life balance has
improved, since I can run the laundry or the dishwasher during sessions rather than
having to cram such chores into my small amount of free-time.” For many clinicians,
working from home allotted them the flexibility to engage in their work in a meaningful
way, despite the many challenges of providing mental health care during the pandemic.
Challenges
Clinicians’ reported challenges to delivering telehealth services were divided into social
concerns, personal concerns, and technological concerns.
Social Concerns. Due to the limits of working from home, clinicians reported
experiencing feelings of isolation and a decrease in informal communication between
co-workers. Participant 5 reported feeling “more distant and disconnected by the missed


8
opportunities for informal chats in doorways while walking back and forth.” Similarly,
Participant 18 felt that their “biggest challenge is missing the connection, camaraderie
with coworkers through those informal interactions at the doorway, water cooler, and
(most importantly) coffee station.” They further explained that they “can't seem to
recreate those (connections) via video check-in.” Many clinicians indicated that they
meet as a group to check-in on staff wellness on a regular basis (66.7%, 20/30) and that
they feel supported by their clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic (83.30%, 25/30).
Clinicians, such as Participant 23, suggested that “regular check-ins and space for
social contact with staff members is helpful,” but cannot replace face-to-face
interaction.
Personal concerns. Personal concerns such as physical discomfort and balancing home
life were seen as impacting clinicians’ ability to focus on telehealth sessions and
manage their time. Multiple clinicians reported feeling “exhaustion from being on the
screen all the time” (Participant 2). Clinicians reported eye strain from looking at
screens and physical discomfort from sitting without substantial movement throughout
the day. Balancing home life, including childcare, was also a major concern among
clinicians. One-third (n=10) of clinicians indicated that they are having a more difficult
time than usual balancing their work and home life. Participant 5 expressed that, “It’s
very hard to have split attention as a working parent...working with young kids in the
home makes it impossible to be fully focused/immersed in work for prolonged periods of
time.” Participant 23 succinctly summed up these concerns by stating, “It’s hard to be a
parent and a therapist under the same roof.” Other distractions related to home life also
made it difficult to work, such as noises from neighbors or another member of the
household working from home. Clinicians without a private office space dedicated to
work expressed more difficulty conducting therapy sessions.


9
Additionally, clinicians reported that there was less mental separation between
work and personal activities when working from home. Participant 13 suggested that
this concern made them less productive: “I associate home with relaxation so it's
sometimes hard to find the drive to want to do a lot of work when I'm at home... also
hard to separate work hours from non-work hours.” On the other hand, Participant 21
suggested that it led them to overwork themselves: “I have less boundaries between
work and home and end up working late into the evening and on weekends when I
normally wouldn't do that as much.” Clinicians indicated that these concerns added
additional stress to the work environment.
Technological concerns. Clinicians had a significant amount of technical difficulties,
including internet connectivity problems and a lack of proper equipment (desktops,
monitors, etc.). Internet connectivity problems were persistent across clinicians from
multiple universities. Participant 16 reported that they experienced “internet
dysconnectivity at the worst possible times on about 5 occasions.” Internet speed
concerns were exacerbated for clinicians who lived with multiple other people using the
same WiFi within their household to work or complete online learning. Multiple
clinicians reported spending personal money to upgrade their internet package or to buy
new computers. Many clinicians agreed that their universities or colleges should
provide their staff with computers and high-speed internet so they would not have to
rely on their own equipment.
Theme 2: Accessibility of Remote-Delivered Services
Clinicians were asked about how the accessibility of services changed as a result of
online delivery. There was an even split of clinicians who reported that accessibility had
either increased or decreased. 36.7% (11/30) of clinicians across universities reported


10
that remote-delivered counseling center services increased students’ access to mental
health care, while 36.7% (11/30) reported that remote-delivered counseling center
services decreased students’ access to mental health care. Both sets of clinicians brought
forward important factors to consider regarding when, how, and for whom remote
delivered services could make mental health treatment more or less accessible. For
example, some clinicians felt that online service delivery was an effective way to
mitigate barriers students typically face in accessing in-person counseling services such
as long commutes, transportation issues, or privacy concerns. Participant 10 explained,
“students have greater access to our service because they do not have the same barriers
to getting to our office as they otherwise would have.” Many clinicians saw telehealth
as a way to offer mental health care to students who may experience barriers to
accessing traditional services.
Clinicians also proposed that online delivery could extend the reach of services
to students who typically might not have engaged with the counseling center.
Participant 24 said, “I can imagine that students who might not have normally come
into the counseling center might be able to access our services easier online.”
Clinicians suggested that increased student engagement may be in part due to greater
convenience experienced by students when accessing services. Participant 18 explained
that it is “easier to log in than to make sure one is physically in the Center.” Overall,
“students appear to enjoy the convenience” (Participant 8).
According to counseling center clinicians, increased flexibility in scheduling
also contributed to greater accessibility for students. Some clinicians started working
alternative hours during the switch to remote delivered services rather than working
their standard business operating hours. This allowed students to access services outside
of traditional business hours and at times that worked better for their schedules.


11
Participant 18 remarked that, “this delivery system offers some flexibility for many of
our students in terms 'fitting in' appointments around other responsibilities in a way
that would be impossible at the Center.” Clinicians felt that “student access to services
is increasing in our office by having evening and weekend hours available” (Participant
4).
While many clinicians saw the potential for remote-delivered services to
increase students’ access to and engagement with mental health care, other clinicians
raised concerns over students’ access to resources that would enable them to
appropriately utilize these services. For some clinicians, it was particularly challenging
to work with students for whom privacy was a concern. Participant 23 expressed that “it
has been more difficult to treat some students with family concerns, as finding privacy
at home for them has been difficult.” This was also highlighted by a clinician who
reported that the quality and depth of their sessions suffered as a result of privacy
concerns. Participant 21 shared:
“I have a client who is in a one-bedroom apartment with her mother and brother,
and therapy often revolves around her unstable relationship with her mother. She
emails me with potential times to meet about every 2-3 weeks when her mother is
going to be at work. We often do phone sessions and she sometimes just goes for a
walk because of the lack of privacy. We end up doing much more case management
than deep therapy because of her current situation.”
For some clinicians, students’ lack of privacy limited the accessibility of remote
delivered services. In addition to concerns over students’ access to a private space,
clinicians also reported how limited access to technology and a reliable internet
connection was a common issue for students. These issues resulted in repeated
disruptions to counseling services. Despite these concerns, clinicians generally


12
remained hopeful about the potential of remote-delivered services to increase the
accessibility of mental health care for college students. Participant 26 shared:
“I believe we can have dedicated staff who provide remote telemental health
services and staff who provide in-person services as well...this model of service
provision could really help a lot of folks if we also take into consideration the
necessity to advocate for the larger community to have access to a working laptop
and internet connection regardless of ability to pay for these services.”
Clinicians emphasized the importance of providing students with tools that
would enable them to effectively engage in remote counseling services.
Theme 3: Therapeutic Alliance
The overwhelming majority of clinicians expressed initial concerns over whether a
strong therapeutic alliance could be maintained over telehealth appointments. First,
telehealth appointments were seen as limiting the clinicians’ ability to obtain clinical
information by observing their clients’ physical and emotional behavior. Participant 3
expressed: “I was concerned about not being able to see the client as well and losing
information I usually gain through observation such as body language.” Similarly,
when a telehealth appointment ended, it could be difficult to gauge the effects of the
session on the client. Participant 21 noted: “I can't tell how beneficial a session was for
a client without asking because I can't get as solid of a sense of their emotional
expression.” Second, clinicians were, “worried about the level of connection that would
be possible (Participant 24)” when establishing initial rapport with clients. Participant 3
described this experience: “I tend to feel more anxious meeting with people, especially
new clients. It takes me longer to feel like I know someone.” Lastly, clinicians expressed
uncertainty about the “depth” of the work they could do remotely, as Participant 5
noted: “Doing more in-depth work has been hard without physical presence.” Overall,


13
clinicians were worried about feeling disconnected to their clients.
Some clinicians expressed that their initial fears around being unable to establish
and maintain therapeutic alliances were relieved and connecting with clients worked
better than they anticipated. When asked about how therapeutic alliance changed as a
result of switching to remote-delivered services, 76.7% (23/30) of clinicians believed
therapeutic alliance had not changed, 16.7% (5/30) believed it had increased, and only
6.7% (2/30) believed it had decreased. Participant 20 commented that, “The connection
is different, but still there and powerful.” A subset of clinicians indicated that delivering
services from home made them more open with clients and the mutual experiences
related to the COVID-19 pandemic had improved their therapeutic alliances. Participant
10 believed that:
“Alliance has increased because we now implicitly share this common bond of
being impacted by COVID. I also think I'm more human to clients now that they
can see my home and very occasionally hear an errant squeal from my daughter in
the background.”
Additionally, one clinician indicated that remote-delivered services may not
carry the same distractions that can take place in the office setting which can promote
connection. Participant 26 indicated, “It has worked for a positive connection with
clients because I am able to follow up with them one-on-one without the interruption of
other students or employees walking into the office space. I can take messages and
follow up.” Despite these potential benefits, some clinicians maintained that face-to
face interactions were preferable for maintaining therapeutic alliance because, “In
person sessions feel more connecting” (Participant 20).
Theme 4: Additional Benefits and Challenges of Remote-Delivered Services
Initial reaction to remote-delivered services


14
Clinicians reported their initial reaction to the switch to remote-delivered services.
While few clinicians felt “very negative/very pessimistic” (3.3%, 1/30), a considerable
number of clinicians felt “negative/pessimistic” (23.3%, 7/30) or “neutral” (26.70%,
8/30) about the transition to remote services. However, the majority of clinicians felt
positive/optimistic (30.00%, 9/30) about the switch, with some clinicians reporting they
felt “very positive/optimistic (16.7%, 5/30).
Benefits
Clinicians reported many benefits associated with remote services such as increased
therapy adherence, attendance, and engagement (see Table 3). Most clinicians (86.7%,
26/30) reported that adherence to treatment had stayed the same or increased due to the
switch to remote-delivered services. Participant 10 noted how,
“Students seem to have fewer barriers to treatment adherence and tend to stick
around for the entirety of the treatment plan. They also seem to seldom feel that
they need a "break" from therapy as they sometimes do when life is busier.”
Participant 26 explained, “students are able to log on with ease (granted they
have consistent internet connection) to connect with their counselor. I believe this
allows students to adhere to a routine.” Clinicians also reported that there were fewer
campus-related activities competing for students’ attention, leading to increased
attendance and less cancelations. Participant 10 stated, “I almost never have a
cancellation or no-show anymore, seemingly because students have less competing for
their time.” Almost all of the clinicians (93.3%, 28/30) felt that that attendance was
unchanged or improved as a result of remote-delivered services in the pandemic.
Clinicians also reported that students’ engagement with services had increased as


15
“students have been more likely to engage in weekly therapy when we previously were
not able to offer this as much” (Participant 21).
Clinicians also reported that remote-delivered services could reduce stigma for
students accessing mental health care. While students would traditionally access these
services from the counseling center, they could now engage with counseling services
from their homes. Clinicians shared that, “meeting remote can feel more comfortable
for clients who are impacted by stigma related to counseling” (Participant 19).
Although not all students benefited from accessing services remotely, one clinician
reported that in some situations there may be “increased privacy for students living at
home” (Participant 17).
Additionally, clinicians noted that remote-delivered care could be as effective as
in-person services, and for some students lead to even better clinical outcomes. In
particular, some clinicians suggested that students with certain presentations, such as
anxiety, may be better suited for remote-delivered services. Participant 11 noted “that
some clients actually connect better virtually and can open up more” and virtual
delivery “reduced the anxiety of sitting face to face in a room with someone.” This was
supported by other clinicians who reported that “my socially anxious students preferred
remote sessions and were able to better engage in them” (Participant 26). Many
clinicians felt that remote-delivered services were effective and even preferred by some
students who “embraced the switch to telehealth” (Participant 15). Participant 9
reflected on the future of remote-delivered services for college students, “I think this is
where the field is heading. Some may be uncomfortable with the idea overall while some
may have discomfort and with time, will experience therapeutic changes regardless of
delivery.”
Challenges


16
Although clinicians identified many advantages to delivering telehealth, some clinicians
expressed concerns around the ethical and legal issues associated with remote delivery
(see Table 3). Clinicians expressed frustration around the limitations of working with
students from out of state as “state licensure laws and recommendations from the
College's legal council have made it not possible for us to provide therapy to out of
state students” (Participant 21). Clinicians also expressed concerns around crises and
hospitalization procedures. Participant 10 shared, “I worried I wouldn't know what to do
if a crisis occurred while I was on a remote session with a student, or worse, in a
group.” Some clinicians felt that these crisis procedures were more difficult to follow
remotely than in-person.
Many clinicians also identified specific clinical presentations that they felt made
it more difficult to provide students with remote-services. Clinicians felt online
counseling services may not be appropriate for all students as “some clients don't seem
to translate to virtual delivery as well as others” (Participant 5). Participant 13 stated
that, “more serious risk concerns/presentations have been harder to manage remotely,
aka, substance abuse, SI, etc.” Other clinicians shared this difficulty and felt that,
“trauma work and more complex presentations are harder to manage remotely”
(Participant 19). Clinicians also found it difficult to support students who may be
feeling isolated due to the pandemic. Participant 10 remarked, “it's also overall more
difficult to help students who feel isolated or are having difficulty making friends, given
the impact of COVID.” Clinicians were increasingly “worried that students felt
disconnected from campus community” and feared that “reaching out to Wellness
Center for support did not seem like an option” (Participant 18).
Lastly, some clinicians felt like online treatment was not as effective as in
person services. Participant 16 indicated they were, “still able to provide effective


17
treatment to clients, although it is not the same (e.g., as effective) as in-person
treatment” and was preferential towards in-person delivery because, “in my strong
opinion, remote services will never be as effective of a treatment for individual
counseling or process groups as compared to in-person treatment.” Participant 21 also
stated, “I don't feel like I am as effective in remote therapy as I am in the office with
clients.”
Clinician preferences for future service delivery
Despite these challenges, when clinicians were asked about their preferences for how
services should be delivered for the remainder of the pandemic, the majority of
clinicians reported wanting to deliver exclusively remote services (86.7%, 26/30), with
only a few clinicians wanting to offer in-person services as well (13.3%, 4/30).
Hybrid Delivery Model
Clinicians were also asked about their preferences for service delivery after the COVID
19 pandemic. Almost all clinicians wanted to continue to offer remote-services to
students, typically as part of a hybrid-model including both in-person and virtual
delivery options. The vast majority (96.7%, 29/30) of clinicians reported wanting to
offer some form of remote services after the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly
reported preference (90%, 27/30) was to deliver either an even split of services or
primarily in-person services with remote services as optional. A minority of clinicians
indicated they would like to deliver exclusively in-person (3.3%, 1/30), exclusively
remote (3.3%, 1/30), or primarily remote services with in-person services as optional
(3.3%, 1/30). Overall, clinicians emphasized the importance of staying flexible and
offering students a choice in service delivery. Participant 2 hoped their counseling
center would have the “flexibility to offer hybrid services to students based on client's


18
needs.” One clinician shared, “The more options we can offer students, the more likely
they are to access services” (Participant 3). Clinicians also felt it was important to
continue to offer in-person services. Participant 26 expressed that, “others may want to
return to face-to-face which I also believe should be offered as well.” Clinicians felt it
could be useful to provide recommendations about which modality might be better
suited for a particular student, “I think students will be given the option of remote or in
person services when meeting for an initial consultation. Therapists can also give
recommendations about which modality based on client presentation” (Participant 28).
Despite wanting to continue to offer in-person services, clinicians recognized that a
remote “delivery system will remain popular with [the] student population” post
pandemic (Participant 18).
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on college students’ mental
health status and well-being, presenting a number of challenges for college counseling
centers. As a response to this, college counseling centers have been delivering mental
health services remotely. It is possible that remote-delivered mental health services can
overcome common barriers associated with traditional, face-to-face care, such as long
waitlists and geographic barriers. Yet, little research has been done to examine the
feasibility and efficacy of remote-delivered services through campus counseling centers,
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study begins to fill this scientific gap,
by examining college counseling center clinicians’ perceptions of remote-delivered
services during the pandemic. As more of the population is vaccinated and colleges and
universities return to normalcy, a better understanding of remote-delivered services and
how clinicians perceive this service is crucial to future implementation of mental health
service delivery on college campuses.


19
In our study, campus counseling center clinicians reported many benefits of
remote-delivered care such as increased accessibility, convenience for both clinicians
and students, and greater treatment adherence. These findings align with past research
showing clinicians’ generally positive attitudes towards tele-health.17 Our findings also
show that despite clinicians’ initial concerns, most campus counseling clinicians felt
that they were able to develop strong therapeutic alliances with students and believed
that online treatment was both effective and efficient. In a narrative review conducted
by Simpson & Reid,21 researchers found that therapeutic alliance developed through
remote-services was comparable to therapeutic alliance developed through in-person
sessions as rated by both clinicians and clients. Given the overlap in these results and
the findings of the present study, future work may focus on communicating to clinicians
that therapeutic alliance in remote-delivered services may not be inferior to that in face
to-face services. Additionally, future work may investigate whether this finding is
consistent across different populations or clinical presentations. Overall, additional
research is needed to determine for whom remote-delivered services may be most
beneficial.
As described in the results, clinicians in this study suggested that students with
anxiety appeared to have preferred the remote-delivered sessions over face-to-face
sessions and were more comfortable engaging in remote sessions. What remains to be
known is whether students with anxiety benefitted from remote-delivered services as
much as, or more than, they would have from face-to-face sessions. In a study
comparing face-to-face therapy to telephone-delivered therapy for depression, Stiles
Shields and colleagues22 found that comorbid anxiety was a differential treatment
predictor. They found that there were no differences in therapy outcomes between
telephone-based therapy and face-to-face therapy among those without comorbid


20
anxiety disorders. However, participants with comorbid anxiety disorders who received
telephone-based therapy had significantly higher symptom severity over time compared
to their counterparts without anxiety, where there were no differences in outcomes
between participants with and without comorbid anxiety disorders who received face
to-face therapy. As clinicians envision the use of telehealth in the post-pandemic world,
it will be valuable to understand that comparative effectiveness of face-to-face and
remote-delivered mental health services for a variety of mental health concerns so that
clinicians may direct students to treatments that are both acceptable to the student and
effective for their presenting concerns.
This study provides evidence of college campus counselors' support for hybrid
treatments of both remote and in-person mental health service delivery on college
campuses. The concept of offering hybrid-treatments align with current findings that
mental health treatment will likely be delivered in a blended format post-pandemic.23 As
such, this crisis may have served as a springboard for beneficial changes for college
student mental health. There has been a recent history of students being dissatisfied with
the available services offered through counseling centers as they often face long
waitlists and a lack of flexibility in scheduling appointments.2 As many of the clinicians
noted, remote-delivered services enabled students to access care from the convenience
of their homes and for some students, led to increased treatment adherence, attendance,
and engagement and reduced stigma in accessing care. These findings align well with
previous literature indicating that college students are interested in nontraditional
mental health tools services as a supplement or enhancement to traditional face-to-face
mental health services.24,25 Many additional benefits related to staff wellness were also
seen. Clinicians reported improved work-life balance, reduced stress, and slight
improvements to job satisfaction and productivity. For both clinicians and students,


21
remote-delivered services appeared to be well-liked and provided many advantages over
face-to-face sessions.
Despite these benefits, participants noted that many challenges of remote
delivered services remain, such as concerns over privacy, internet connectivity,
technology access, and ethical and legal considerations. Challenges such as the inability
for clinicians to see students across state lines limited the widespread accessibility and
efficacy of remote mental health services and should be considered when envisioning
mental health services after the pandemic. The APA26 has begun to develop guidelines
and loosen restrictions around remote-service delivery through college campus
counseling centers, highlighting the shift towards and acceptance of remote-delivered
mental health services on college campuses. However, additional work must be done in
order to ensure that students have access to remote mental health care and the tools and
resources necessary to best utilize these services.
In addition, more resources are needed to support clinicians’ well-being during
remote-service delivery including those that focus on social isolation, increasing
interactions with co-workers, and providing equipment that supports working from
home such as computers and home offices. Developing protocols and additional
guidance on maintaining staff wellness and an optimal work environment for campus
counseling clinicians delivering remote mental health services may help to address
clinicians' concerns and improve the adoption and delivery of online mental health care
to college students.
Limitations
This study has several limitations which must be considered when interpreting the
results. First, while the institutions that chose to participate in this study ranged in size
and represented both community colleges and 4-year universities, this study focused on


22
campuses from one geographic area in the United States. Second, counseling center
directors served as the gatekeepers for study participation, and therefore these results
may not be representative of all counseling centers. Lastly, the clinicians included in
this sample were mostly female-identifying and non-Hispanic white. Future work may
focus on recruiting a more diverse sample of college counseling center clinicians.
Conclusion
This study advances the current literature on clinician perceptions of remote-delivered
services by being the first study to examine the attitudes of campus counseling center
clinicians’ towards delivering remote mental health services to college students during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provide initial evidence for the successful
delivery of remote-delivered mental health services on college campuses that are
accessible outside of face-to-face provision. Additionally, the challenges and limitations
reported by clinicians in this study can inform researchers and universities of the areas
that will need to be addressed if remote-services are to be delivered on a wider scale. By
understanding college counseling center clinicians’ response to remote-delivered
services, researchers and administrators can work towards designing remote-mental
health services that are effective, accessible, and tailored to college students' needs post
pandemic.
