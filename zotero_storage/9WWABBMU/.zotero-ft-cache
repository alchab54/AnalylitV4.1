INEQUALITIES IN REMOTE THERAPY

Abstract
COVID-19 has triggered a shift towards remote delivery of therapy and, despite a number of
benefits, it risks discriminating against young people already marginalised due to adverse
early life experiences, poverty or ethnicity. This editorial perspective considers challenges
for remote therapy, focusing on the financial burden of telehealth; the necessity of safety to
speak; and, how telehealth may exacerbate difficulties in therapeutic alliance formation by
interfering with epistemic trust and mentalising. As well as compounding the inaccessibility
for children who are subject to abuse, the implicit assumptions behind telehealth risk
disproportionately excluding from therapy those from a low socio-economic status, and who
are from ethnic minorities. Suggestions are made for how these challenges may be
addressed. It is argued that service design and delivery should seek to proceed with the
practicalities and principles of engagement in mind and use this as an opportunity to improve
parity of access, rather than risk further entrenching inequalities.

COVID-19 and teletherapy
Across the world, COVID-19 has had a profound effect on people’s mental wellbeing:
impacting both mental health needs and the provision of mental health care. A rapid shift to
remote delivery of mental health assessment and treatment has enabled services to be
delivered when face-to-face meetings are not possible or safe. For some, this has signalled
a welcome acceleration of existing long-term plans towards delivering therapy that is more
scalable and better able to meet growing demand. But, the shift to telehealth also has its
challenges and there is a risk that it perpetuates or even exacerbates a lack of parity of
access and care depending on individual and group factors. We consider three challenges in
our bid to avoid repeating prior inequalities: the financial burden of teletherapy; the necessity
of safety to speak; and, how telehealth may intensify challenges for engagement and
therapeutic alliance formation. We focus on care of young people in the UK, where 1:6 6-16
year-olds had a probable mental health issue in 2021 (NHS Digital, 2021), though the
principles identified are likely more broadly applicable. Creative solutions are suggested to
address limitations so that young people are not systematically excluded from mental health
support, pandemic or no.
Challenge 1: the financial burden of teletherapy and who is most affected
The UK NHS is free at the point of delivery, yet assumptions of device and data
access inherent in telehealth threaten this key ethos. For instance, this assumption likely
precludes the 4.2 million young people growing up in poverty, or the 37% of working-class
children who do not have internet access at home (Francis-Devine, 2020). These numbers
will likely grow due to COVID-19 related unemployment, particularly among families in the
bottom earning bracket who are the least likely to have been able to work remotely from
home. More alarming still is that across a number of surveys children in low income families
are reporting greater impact of COVID-19 on their mental wellbeing, especially in rates of
anxiety and depression meaning the mental health impact of COVID-19 is felt strongest by
those most affected by the cost of telehealth.

Poverty rates vary by ethnicity, and so a policy which disproportionately impacts those
living in poverty, may also disproportionately impact individuals from certain ethnic groups.
The UK government estimate that 29% of children from Bangladeshi households, 24% of
children from Pakistani households and 22% of children from Black households are living in
material deprivation, compared to 10% of children from White households (Office for
National Statistics, 2020). This means that at least 25,400 children from Bangladeshi,
Pakistani and Black households may experience a mental health issue whilst living in
material deprivation likely to preclude them from accessing remote therapyi. In fact, the
number is likely much higher as children from households in the bottom 20% of income in
the UK are as much as four-to-five times more likely to develop a mental health problems.
Furthermore, ethnicity will also affect the likelihood someone develops a mental health issue
due to the impact of racism, discrimination and individual and societal challenges, and so the
intersectionality of these issues must be considered. Our capacity to fully understand this is
limited by groupings made in the reporting of government data and this should be rectified in
future government reports. For instance, the grouping of ‘Black households’, as opposed to
considering how children from Caribbean, African or Mixed Black households may be
differently affected.
Of course, not all children from these ethnic groups will be raised in material
deprivation and all those growing up in material deprivation are not captured in the most at
risk ethnic groups that have been discussed here. Moreover, experiences of racism or
mental health issues in any ethnic group will vary and so it is important to acknowledge
variation in the way inequality will be felt. What we highlight here are just some of the
consequences of policy changes, and how these may be unfairly experienced by certain
groups due to socio-economic status and demographic factors that intersect with this. This is
unacceptable and only widens the disparity of care.
For telehealth to work we need co-created approaches that address these disparities,
such as social prescribing of phone contracts; local schools loaning out devices to young
people who are engaging in therapy; partnerships with charities to receive old smart phones;

or, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds being prioritised for face-to-face therapy.
The pros and cons of these and other ideas should be considered by local task and finish
groups or ICS’s to coordinate local action alongside service user groups.
Challenge 2: Physical and mental safety to speak
For telehealth to work, there is an assumption that young people have a safe, private
space to speak to their therapist whilst at home, which for many will not be true. Prior to
COVID-19, the NSPCC reported that violence against children in the UK is committed every
seven minutes. Since COVID-19, this has likely worsened, with the UN describing the rise in
domestic violence as a ‘shadow pandemic’. As well as affecting their mental and physical
wellbeing, this means many young people will not have the physical safety to speak.
Moreover, even if the abuser is physically absent, these young people are unlikely to
experience the mental space for autonomy and self-hood whilst in the environment where
abuse takes, or has taken, place. Young people are more likely to be hypervigilant and
aroused in this environment, which will particularly affect their capacity to mentalise, the
process of understanding the beliefs, feelings and goals that motivate our own and others’
actions. Mentalising the self, and being mentalised by the therapist is key to therapeutic
relationships: enabling the client to safely think about themselves and bring an awareness of
how they influence and are influenced by the world (Fonagy et al., 2017). Mentalising
develops in the context of attachment relationships and the capacity to mentalise is
disrupted by trauma and abuse from caregivers, meaning that (again) those most in need of
support, are also the least likely to be able to engage with it remotely.
Creative ways to find a consistent safe space to engage in telehealth are needed, and
these must be collaborative, giving agency to the young person who should lead the search,
with principles of safety in mind. For instance, flexibly adapt to a young person’s suggestion
of where they feel safe to speak, be it at a friend’s, a relative’s, or in a local public space, like
a park. Within the home, it may be possible to alter aspects of the physical environment to
create a ‘therapy space’, either by setting up a corner of a room facing a window or calming
poster; or, co-creating a ‘therapy fort’ with younger children, the set-up and dismantling of


INEQUALITIES IN REMOTE THERAPY

which offers a way to ease in and out of therapy. Additional sessions may be required to
facilitate development of these spaces, or to account for the time lost each week in the
setting-up and dismantling of the space. Time-limited therapeutic models will need to adjust
for this while noting that joint working in this pursuit may enhance trust, generate sense of
agency and benefit treatment outcomes.
Challenge 3: developing a therapeutic alliance and the need for epistemic trust
The capacity to engage young people in the therapeutic alliance is crucial for
optimising therapy and has a causal link with outcomes that transcends therapeutic
modalities. These associations may reasonably be expected to persist into the digital
sphere, however, factors affecting remote alliance development provide fresh challenges.
For instance, telehealth may interfere with establishment of epistemic trust, defined as
communication characterised by trust in the authenticity and relevance of information shared
by another. Epistemic trust is crucial for positive therapeutic outcomes, as it allows the
young person to integrate new information shared by the therapist and so facilitates
therapeutic change. As epistemic trust develops in the context of attachment relationships,
many young people arrive at therapy in a state of epistemic hypervigilance, in which they
have learnt to reject communicated information, expecting it to be unreliable or mal
intentioned. As such, young people subject to maltreatment or abuse are more likely to
present with epistemic mistrust or vigilance, which will impact their engagement with
therapy, and predicts poorer treatment outcomes (Fonagy et al., 2017).
When working face-to-face, epistemic vigilance would be addressed therapeutically
through the use of ostensive cues and mentalising. However, research suggests ostensive
cues of subtleties in tone of voice or facial expression can be disrupted in remote
communications (Fonagy et al., 2020). How can eye contact be meaningfully used when you
are continually forced to choose between looking into a camera, at your therapist’s video or
at your own video? Mentalising failures also mean that remote delivery can increase the
intensity or frequency of feelings of rejection in those hypersensitive or prone to over
interpreting the actions of others, as shown with adult clients (Wurman et al., 2020). So,

telehealth may work well for the vast majority, providing reassuring average outcome
statistics. But those whose history includes communication disadvantages may be least able
to overcome shortcomings without additional assistance.
Clearly adaptations are required. You may exaggerate, or combine multiple physical
ostensive cues for understanding to ensure they are not missed (Fisher et al., 2020), such
as groaning or shaking your head in addition to furrowing your brow in order to signal and
marked-mirror disbelief prompted by what the client shared. Likewise, as the therapist has
less access to the client’s implicit forms of communication (e.g. eye gaze or body language)
the ‘not-knowing’ stance or curiosity may be even more vital as well as frequently ‘checking
in’ and indicating explicitly how they are experiencing the discussion (Fonagy et al., 2020).
Additional therapeutic sessions may be required, particularly for those least trusting to reach
a point where they can meaningfully benefit from therapy. For some, it may be appropriate to
more actively recruit the young person’s broader personal and professional support network
into their care by offering psychoeducation on developing mentalising skills and developing
epistemic trust. By incorporating those who do have direct face-to-face contact with the
child, they may be able to offer an in-person bridge that enables the young person to
practice and try-out the processes of mentalising in real life.
Another challenge to remote alliance formation is that therapist-client differences in
relation to Burnham’s social graces (Burnham, 1992) may feel more exaggerated in a
remote setup, or may be more easily overlooked. Previously invisible or unvoiced aspects of
the therapist’s and client’s identity may become more noticeable in the alliance when
working from home and communicating remotely. For instance, what does the room behind
or the background noise suggest about their class, culture or spirituality? How does the
intersectionality of these and other aspects of their identity and lived experience align or
differ from aspects of the other’s? Some features of identity may feel more visible or voiced
in a remote set-up, for instance for some Orthodox Jewish clients, their religion may
preclude the use of a smartphone requiring a telephone call instead; whilst for others,
aspects of their identity may be less observable, such as the use of a walking aid, which


INEQUALITIES IN REMOTE THERAPY

may not be visible in remote therapy but which will be more visible when meeting face-to
face. It is important to notice how these shifts in the way we access and engage with both
identity and specifically the multiple needs that some young people present with in therapy
are impacted in both the young person and the therapist, and for these to be openly named
and discussed within the therapeutic space.
Summary
Whether the move to remote therapy is motivated by policies or pandemics, it is
important to consider the impact of change. We identify three obvious foci for action. The
first, well recognised issue of digital exclusion may be compounded by intersectionality
leaving particular high-risk groups least will provided for and needing concerted local
initiatives to address their need. Second, while some children with maltreatment histories
may feel paradoxically safer communicating through digital media, for others triggers may
compromise engagement and they need to be creatively supported in finding an appropriate
accessible space from which they feel safe to speak. Third, therapists cannot be assumed to
fully adapt their skills to remote delivery, particularly with clients who in any case arrive for
reasons of disadvantage and multiple needs with limited capacity to trust and engage in
forming a therapeutic alliance formation; additional training may be crucial for therapy
success. Unless we seek to address the challenges outlined here, we may see the disparity
in treatment outcomes widen and we will have found a new way to fail those who need the
most support. Let us seize the opportunity to overhaul a system marred by inequalities in
access and care.
