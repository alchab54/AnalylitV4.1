Abstract
Background and Purpose: Low back pain is a multidimensional disorder and a
biopsychosocial management approach is recommended. However, recent data in
dicates that physiotherapists mainly focus on biomechanical aspects in treatment
and struggle with addressing psychosocial barriers for recovery. We wanted to
explore how physiotherapists express their experiences of building therapeutic al
liances within a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain.
Methods: Qualitative focus‐group interviews were performed with five physio
therapists on two occasions with 6 months in between. Data were analyzed within a
hermeneutical perspective with decontextualization and recontextualization, and
identification of themes.
Results: Four main themes were identified from the analyses: (1) An ideal standard:
Presence, empathy and applying the biopsychosocial perspective is central for
building therapeutic alliance. (2) Time‐consuming: Active listening and personally
adapted treatment is important and time‐consuming. (3) Challenging area: Advanced
clinical reasoning is needed to understand and modify complex barriers for recov
ery. Clinical experience is sometimes necessary to integrate the psychological and
social domains into physiotherapy management. (4) The art of balancing: Important
to apply sensitive communication to help patients gain new insight. Some heavy
psychosocial demands on patients may be outside physiotherapists' professional
competence.
Discussion: The physiotherapists in this focus group study expressed a shared
view that therapeutic alliance should build upon person‐centering, motivational
communication, and facilitation of lifestyle adjustments within a biopsychosocial
perspective of low back pain. Complex clinical reasoning necessary as the optimal
cause‐corrective treatment strategies were often not obvious. Time and tools to
uncover and modify relevant psychological obstacles for recovery were perceived
challenging and partly dependent on clinical experience. Addressment of
psychosocial obstacles for recovery should be included in basic as well as
postgraduate curriculums for physiotherapists. Collaborative practice support

1 | INTRODUCTION
Low back pain is a main cause of disability globally, and the conse
quences and maintaining factors are complex, demanding a multidi
mensional management approach (Dutmer et al., 2019; Foster
et al., 2018). The biopsychosocial model consider interaction be
tween various health determinants and provide a basis for compre
hensive care (Johnson et al., 2018). Within this model, management
should include measures of possibly modifiable contributing factors
like pain self‐efficacy, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, social func
tioning and work absenteeism (Tagliaferri et al., 2020). However,
integration of the psychosocial domain in low back pain physio
therapy management is not optimal (Husted et al., 2020; Schaum
berg, 2020). Physiotherapists have reported a lack of confidence to
apply psychosocial strategies in their practice (Driver, Lovell, &
Oprescu, 2019) and barely include psychosocially oriented illness
perceptions in history taking (Roussel et al., 2016). In line with this, a
qualitative survey indicated that self‐management support provided
to patients by physiotherapists are affected by a lack of tools and
mainly related to biomechanical factors (Hutting et al., 2020).
Patients, however, want integration of psychosocial perspectives
(Chou et al., 2018).
A critical review has also indicated a lack of research on how
the biopsychosocial model is conceptualized in physiotherapy
(Mescouto et al., 2020). Social aspects seem to be frequently
neglected while the psychological dimension tend to be reduced to
cognitive‐behavioral factors. The complexity of low back pain calls
for a wider clinical perspective. Recently, a contemporary frame
work for the biopsychosocial model in musculoskeletal physio
therapy has been presented, based on an evolutionary concept
analysis (Daluiso‐King & Hebron, 2020). Communication was found
to scaffold the framework, supporting the exploration of a person's
lifeworld through the therapeutic alliance. Increased knowledge is
needed on how to increase the capacity of therapists to develop
soft skills for enhancing therapeutic alliance in clinical musculo
skeletal practice (Babatunde et al., 2017; Sondena et al., 2020). On
this background we aimed to explore a group of physiotherapists'
shared experience of building therapeutic alliance for low back
pain.
Study question:
How do physiotherapists experience the process of building
therapeutic alliances with patients in biopsychosocially oriented
treatment of longstanding low back pain?
2 | METHOD
2.1 | Design
We chose to use a hermeneutical design with an interpretative
approach to investigate the experiences and perceptions of the
physiotherapists. This design involves focusing on the participants'
experiences and describe these experiences in the words of the par
ticipants. People's experiences are, however, always contextualized,
and this requires interpretation in the situational context. In this way,
the study becomes hermeneutical when the researchers makes an
interpretation of the meaning of the experiences (Creswell, 2007).
Thus, our study design is a hermeneutical one, promoting the
participants' own voices and interpreting their voices in the context
of current physiotherapy practice (Creswell, 2007; Granskär
et al., 2012).
2.2 | Setting
This study was undertaken as part of an observational study
involving a range of physiotherapy clinics (Nordstoga et al., 2019).
The setting was a collaboration group for clinicians and researchers
in musculoskeletal physiotherapy.
2.3 | Sampling and recruitment
The inclusion criteria were to be a physiotherapist, to have experi
ence‐, current clinical activity and interest for patients attending
physiotherapy for low back pain. Physiotherapists in the project
group for the quantitative study (Nordstoga et al., 2019) were invited
to participate in this focus group study to share their experiences.
The present study thus recruited from a group of physiotherapists
working with patients with low back pain and having volunteered to
contribute in a research project. We considered this group a po
tential source of rich information on building therapeutic alliances
within a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain. Thus, the
sample is strategic (Marshall et al., 2006). Information about
the current study were provided oral in face‐to‐face meetings and
supplemented with a written invitation letter via emails. Five phys
iotherapists gave their written consent to participate in the study.
The physiotherapists who did not respond to the invitation letter

were not asked to give any reason for choosing not to participate. To
maintain the participants' anonymity they will be referred to as
participant no. 1, no. 2, and so on.
2.4 | Data collection
We chose to use focus group interviews as our data collection
method. The aim of this method is to collect descriptions about the
participants' experiences with respect to interpretation of the
described experiences (Tjora, 2018). Group interviews are suitable
for investigating the characteristics and dynamics of groups as
constitutive forces in the construction of meaning and practices
(Kamberelis & Dimitriadis, 2005). The participants in our study are
experienced in their field; they interact closely with the patients and
are in a position to facilitate, promote or prevent new ways of in
teractions and patient‐therapist cooperation. To allow for shared
perspectives to develop and be expressed, two group interviews
were conducted with the participants, the second one approximately
six months after the first one. In the first group interview all five
physiotherapists participated, in the second one four of the physio
therapists participated. The second group interview were performed
as an elaboration and member checking of the first one. Member
checking, also known as participant validation, is a technique for
exploring credibility of results and maintaining validity in qualitative
research (Birt et al., 2016; Candela, 2019).
The authors developed a semi‐structured interview guide for
interview number one. The guide built on dialog with colleagues, the
authors' clinical and scientific experience and a literature review of
topics related to therapeutic alliance and to physiotherapists' ap
proaches to patients with low back pain. Before the interviews, we
discussed our expectations and the themes that we were eager to
explore. Examples of questions in the guide are; “What do you think it
takes to be a good physiotherapist?” and “What do you expect when
you get a patient with low back pain?” and “In your opinion, what is
important to motivate patients and increase compliance?” The second
focus group interview took its point of departure in subjects
emerging from the first group interview. These are examples of
subjects discussed in this interview; what are the most essential tools
to build therapeutic alliances, and personal experiences of working
with complex and unspecific cases. The interview guide was used as a
“to‐do list” helping the interviewer to cover all subjects. Thus, all
subjects in the interview guide were discussed, but every single
question in the guide were not necessarily posed. The participants
were provided information about topics in advance of the interviews,
but not the whole topic guide. The interviews were carried out by
both authors, the last author being a moderator and the first being a
co‐moderator and taking notes. The moderator and the participants
had not met prior to the first interview, and the moderator was
presented as a researcher from the university. Both authors are fe
male physiotherapists and researchers, and the participants knew the
first author from the larger study, which this study is nested in. The
last author is experienced within qualitative research and ‐data
collection. The first author is experienced within low back pain clinics
and research.
Before the interview started, information about the study was
repeated, emphasizing the study's aim and research question as well
as research ethics, including volunteerism, informed consent, and
confidentiality. Both interviews lasted for about 90–120 min. The
interviews took place after working hours in an office at the primary
physiotherapy service administration. All topics in the topic guide
were discussed during the interviews, and both interviews were
audio‐taped and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were
without personally identifiable data and each participant was
assigned a number.
2.5 | Data analyses
Both authors analyzed the data, first separately then collectively.
During the analytical process, we aimed to be open minded, curious,
and reflective about our own pre‐understanding and in promoting
the participants' genuine voices. Initially in the analysis process, we
held a workshop with the participants discussing our preliminary
findings and thoughts, getting feedback and their recognition.
There is a variety of approaches to analyzing qualitative data,
though these have some analytical elements in common, for example,
the de‐ and re‐contextualization of data. First, the authors read and
re‐read the interview transcripts separately, highlighting significant
excerpts, statements, and quotes. Statements illuminating the par
ticipants' experiences and perceptions were classified as significant.
Such elements were often identified by the participants' use of
emotional or value‐laden expressions, such as “a difficult group
of patients” “very demanding” or “very important.” This first reading
and re‐reading after the interviews is called horizonalization
(Creswell, 2007). The rest of the analysis was performed in close
collaboration between the two authors. We independently read the
excerpts that contextualized the highlighted statements, and
we independently coded them. Then, we discussed our coding until
we reached a consensus on clusters of meaning across transcripts.
Examples of such clusters of meaning; demanding, preferable, diffi
cult, and gets tired. Finally, we wrote a composite description that
presented the essence of the participants' experiences and the un
derlying structure/themes of their experiences (Creswell, 2007).
Examples of the analytical process are shown in Table 1.
In the results section, these findings are illustrated by the most
meaningful quotations from the interviews, and all participants are
represented through the quotations.
2.6 | Ethical considerations
Both authors are physical therapists and researchers. We are aware
that our experiences as therapists influenced our pre‐understanding
of important components in successful physiotherapy treatment. To
avoid our pre‐understanding governing our investigation we

consulted fellow researchers and previous research on the topic.
Further, we aimed at transparency at all stages of the research
process, describing every step of the research process and our
interpretation of empiricism. Thus, we have strived to achieve
dependability and confirmability (Lincoln & Cuba, 1985). All partici
pants were assured that participation was voluntary and that they
could withdraw at any moment without any consequences and they
all signed an informed consent. The study was approved by the
Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (regis
tration no. 2013/2244/REKmidt).
3 | RESULTS
Focus group interviews are well suited to investigate the construc
tion of meaning and practices. While this is at the core of what we
wanted to investigate, participating in focus group discussions also
implies that it might be hard to express other opinions than the
implicitly adopted norms in the group. Five physiotherapists with
interest for and ongoing experience with the treatment of patients
with low back pain were included. The length of the participants'
clinical experience varied. The sample consist of both female and
male physiotherapists, and therapists with long clinical experience
and with shorter clinical experience. The participants were active in a
collaboration network for low back pain physiotherapy. We found
that even though the participants generally shared the same expe
riences, it differed somewhat in how they related their experiences.
As the results show they all experienced building therapeutic alli
ances with patients as a standard for competent physiotherapists,
simultaneously as they also found it time‐consuming, challenging and
as an art of balancing. In the result section we will elaborate on the
similarities and differences in the participants' perceptions of their
shared experiences.
3.1 | Ideal characteristics of physiotherapists
In both focus group discussions, the physiotherapists agreed that the
patient‐therapist relationship was essential for the outcome of the
treatment. Building trust and facilitating an open dialog, in addition to
being an expert on biomechanical issues, were perceived as an ideal
standard characterizing a competent physiotherapist. Participant no.
1 expressed: “It is about the patient‐therapist role, about how the
chemistry is there, and earning the patients' trust. Creating trust
requires quite a lot of work from the therapist.” Participant no. 4
elaborated a little bit more on this trust building saying:
Quote: “Presence and empathy, the feeling of being
taken care of. You get a deeper breath, you feel
accepted, you feel included. Good things start to
happen in the body. And to have time, I believe that is
half the treatment.”
To fulfill this standard was perceived as exiting and interesting,
but also challenging. Participant no. 5 explained:
Quote: “It is important to early uncover if the patients
are afraid, and what their worries are. Is it not coming
back to work? Is it the pain as such, or is it the
persistence of the pain? To clarify this a little early is
our essential role here. This is what I find exiting, when
you can communicate with a patient that understands
that things are connected and when you do not meet
someone with high resistance against reflecting
around the pain. It can be challenging and exiting, I
believe, to uncover their thoughts and beliefs about
this.”
Though everybody agreed that building a therapeutic alliance
with the patients is essential for the outcome of the treatment we
found some variations in how they emphasized this and how the
psychosocial domain was implemented into practice. Such a variation
can be illustrated by the words of participant no. 5: “It is something
with the patient‐therapist relation, it increases the effect. What it
means remains to be defined. There are limits as to how much you
need. Some are very fond of talking.” What participant no. 5 is
expressing here we understand as an ambivalence about what a
therapeutic alliance really should entail, and even maybe a little re
straint concerning the open dialog as “some are very fond of talking.”
This restraint may indicate an uncertainty in one's own capacity to
address psychological aspects of low back pain.
3.2 | Time‐consuming
Fulfilling the normative standard of a competent physiotherapist was
unanimously expressed as time‐consuming. On the one hand, the
participants highlighted the importance of time and that they as

independent therapists were able to prioritize time for the individual
patients. On the other hand, they also work at a tight schedule. How
they balanced this tightrope of their time schedule appeared to vary.
While some of the participants highlighted advantages of being a self
employed person, others emphasized disadvantages of such organi
zation of work. Participants no. 5 and no. 3 seems to belong to the
first group, proclaiming that: “What we have that is unique is the
time. I believe that time is our great resource and strength. In many
cases the anamnesis that took too long time is the most important
part” (no. 5). “You can't be sure of getting all information the first day.
But maybe next time, when they have gone home and thought about
what you said the first time” (no. 3). Discussing how to conduct an
anamnesis in patient assessment and how long time to spend on this
engaged the participants. Participant no. 4 describe a dilemma that
several of the participants confirmed that they recognized:
Quote: “The pros with the long anamneses are that the
patients feel very heard and taken care of. So, provided
you have the time it is really smart. But it is a bit scary
asking those questions, because it can turn out that
they say “Well, it started in 1970.” Sometimes it is OK
to be a bit specific, like for instance: “Why are you here
today?” I believe it is depending on how much you ask.
90% of the population have something that we can talk
about, right. Sometimes it can be useful to include a lot
of other stuff, but then you have quite another pack
age. And other times I only have this hour and then the
next patient is coming, so now we must stick to this.”
This dilemma between prioritizing to initiate a time‐consuming
anamnesis, which they know might be “really smart,” and being “a
bit specific” due to a tight schedule and the next patient is a dilemma
of their everyday practice. Another element, which we also find
interesting, is the “scary” part of asking “those questions” which
might lead to “quite another package.” As we understand it this
“other package” is a package that might include unexpected psy
chological, social or environmental aspects of living with low back
pain. Thus, it might be better to stick to the more familiar biome
chanical aspects of the issue, which might not be as time‐consuming.
Participant no. 3 expressed some perceptions that reflects the time
squeeze of the participants' everyday practice: «It is good that they
buy what we sell. I do not bother to spend my time if they do not do
the exercises that I have given them.”
3.3 | Challenging area
The need for patience, flexibility and broad competence in order to
target the cause of low back pain was agreed on in this group of
physiotherapists: One of the challenges the participants experienced
was the complexity of low back pain which sometimes led to un
certainty about how to best help the patients. Discussing how to best
target the cause of back pain participant no. 1 said:
Quote: “On one side it is a somewhat difficult patient
group because many have had their complaints for
many years. And then you can choose to go in and
target it symptomatically or you can try to go to the
cause in a way.” (no. 1)
Participant no. 5 expressed it this way: «Working with these
patients can be demanding. It can be hard not having a quick fix, and
instead use other tools that can be unfamiliar for the patients.” Again,
there was some variation in which treatment tools and therapist skills
our informants emphasized. Communication was shared as impor
tant. While some focused on empathetic listening and communication
about patients' beliefs and thought, others were more focused on
selling in the program: This difference in focus are illuminated in the
following quotes:
Quote: “I believe it is very important how we commu
nicate our thoughts. We must avoid overwhelming the
patient with information, especially the patient that
is afraid to begin with. It increases the pain picture.”
(no. 4)
Quote: “Communication and selling in the program can
be challenging. Making them believe in what is a bit
diffuse for us. Yes, a salesperson in some way.” (no. 3)
As we understand it the participants here agree on the impor
tance of communication and information, but also discuss practical
approaches and challenges. Such challenges are “how much infor
mation is optimal?” and “to what time?” and how to motivate a
patient about an exercise program if you are still not positive about
the main cause of the patient's low back pain. Participant no. 4
expressed: “I do not find it difficult to convince (the patient) about
the connections if I know what the connections are.” Our inter
pretation is that the essence in this quote are reflected by the
words “If I know what the connections are.” Triggering factors for
low back pain may be complex, and to feel confident enough to
navigate through the biopsychosocial spectrum requires some clin
ical experience as a physiotherapist. Discussing these challenges,
participant no. 2 sums up:
Quote: “I believe that you need a bit of experience as a
physiotherapist. Having worked with the mechanical
factors at first and got to know and seen that you can
ease symptoms and the like and be safe in that.
I believe that it takes a whole lot to become a good
therapist on the complex. It takes more time.” (no. 2)
We found that even though the participants perceived the
challenges a little bit different they all agreed on the importance of
communication, the need for advanced clinical reasoning given the
complexity of low back pain and therefore; a need for clinical expe
rience as a physiotherapist.

3.4 | The art of balancing your practice
There was agreement in the group that in order to obtain treatment
success and to avoid burn‐out for the therapist there is a fine balance
between a narrow biomechanical focus and going too far into the
psychosocial domain. This balancing can be interesting but also
demanding. Participants no. 3 and no. 5 expressed this:
Quote: “Challenges are fun, but it is hard to assess a
back in many cases. Sometimes you only find some
thing vague and cannot put your finger on something
structural.” (no. 3).
Quote: “This demanding complex patient is not always
easy to sort out. But it is fun when you have in
terventions that help.” (no. 5).
While all aspects of the biopsychosocial models were agreed
upon as relevant in anamnesis and taken into consideration, our
participants perceived a risk of exceeding their competence as a
physiotherapist as well as their emotional capacity in some cases.
Quote: “I do know colleagues that are completely
exhausted because they are psychologists and peda
gogics, and it is marriage counseling and they become
exhausted. Maybe it started with a simple low back
pain, and then all these other factors came up.
Listening to one after the other can be burdensome.
You can become worn out after the day if there are
many of that type. I could not be a psychologist.” (no. 4)
Quote (response to quote above): “Me neither. You get
worn out if it is a lot of the heavy stuff.” (no. 1)
The positive and stimulating experiences of the clinical reasoning
process and of helping patients gain new insights, and thereby long
term improvement, was also expressed:
It is something about getting inside, and to reflect on
what can I do here. It may be something important
here. (no. 5)
In summary, while the “time‐consuming” and “challenging area”
themes were more connected to practical organization of the phys
iotherapists' work, the “normative standard” and “the art of
balancing” themes were more overarching and connected to ethical
principles and the therapists' perspective on low back pain and its
appropriate management. We found agreement in the group that
longstanding low back pain was a multidimensional phenomenon and
that patient‐centered care aiming on behavioral change was a
normative standard. However, the group dialog brought up some
nuances in the participants' preferred approaches to obtain such a
therapeutic alliance.
4 | DISCUSSION
In this focus group study, we explored the experience of phys
iotherapists of building therapeutic alliances with patients within
a biopsychosocial understanding of low back pain. We found four
main themes: An ideal standard, time‐consuming, challenging
area, and the art of balancing your practice. The therapists
shared a multidimensional perspective on low back pain, though
some tension appeared connected to how and whether to
address the psychological aspects of low back pain. Person
centering and communication with active listening were collec
tively described as main tools in building therapeutic alliances
with the patients. The art of balancing as a professional between
helping patients towards new insights by applying time and un
familiar tools, and on the other side the importance of profes
sional limits was also expressed via the group dialog. The
therapists shared a closeness to the complexity of low back pain
and an enthusiasm above being able to uncover connections in
close cooperation with the patients, but also a humility above
the reality that sometimes the connections were too complex to
fully comprehend.
Communication scaffolds the contemporary conceptual
framework of the biopsychosocial model in musculoskeletal
physiotherapy and supports explorations of the patients' lifeworld
through the therapeutic alliance (Daluiso‐King & Hebron, 2020).
The biomedical theme included the sub‐theme education, where
information transfer was central. For information to be mean
ingful, it should be integrated into the individual patients'
complexly interrelated social, psychological and biomedical
context. This is in correspondence with the findings in the present
study. Our participants agreed on the importance as well as the
challenges of communication and emphasized different aspects of
communication. Some of our participants described embracing the
complexity of exploring these interrelationships in close cooper
ation with the patients. Others were more reluctant and
emphasized the importance of staying within professional borders.
This relates to the master themes of communication and indi
vidualized care which were intricately linked to the process of
building a therapeutic alliance, according to the framework
(Daluiso‐King & Hebron, 2020). This is also in correspondence
with patients' own experience of personally adapted education as
a meaningful aspect of the therapeutic alliance (Unsgaard‐Ton
del & Soderstrom, 2021).
Though applying a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain
emerged as a shared normative standard, the contents and tools
towards a therapeutic alliance were varying. Some tension between
participants were expressed that acknowledging the multidimen
sional nature of low back pain did not automatically mean that going
into the psychosocial challenges was the optimal treatment strategy.
This may indicate an uncertainty in one's own capacity to address
psychological aspects of low back pain which will be consistent with
the findings of another study (Driver, Oprescu, & Lovell, 2019).
Driver and coworkers also found that though physiotherapists

incorporated an advanced biopsychosocial insight into low back pain,
the extent to which psychosocial strategies and tools were applied,
depended on factors like earlier treatment success with‐, and confi
dence towards such strategies. Yet another qualitative study also
found that while physiotherapists recognized the multi‐dimensional
nature of low back pain and the need to manage it from a bio
psychosocial perspective, the clinical addressment of psychological
factors was viewed as challenging due to a lack of training and
guidance (Cowell et al., 2018). While some of our participants were
reluctant to address complexity, others expressed an enthusiasm for
reflecting on deeper connections in close cooperation with the pa
tient. This finding may be seen in the context on earlier studies
indicating a general lack of integration of the social dimension and
reduction of the psychological dimension (Mescouto et al., 2020).
Moreover, physiotherapists have expressed a wish for further
training in psychosocial strategies in their practice (Driver, Lovell, &
Oprescu, 2019). In our study, participants expressed clinical experi
ence as a key to confidence when assessing of psychosocial factors.
This view of clinical experience as crucial was shared despite a
varying length of clinical experience in our focus group. Schaumberg
also reported that clinicians with less than 5 years of experience
asked fewer psychosocial questions than more experienced col
leagues (Schaumberg, 2020).
Contributing to improvement for patients with heavy psycho
social obstacles, for example, trauma or high degree of resistance,
was experienced as challenging of all participants. Still, some par
ticipants expressed self‐efficacy towards contributing to correct
mistaken beliefs and thereby remove possible psychological obsta
cles for recovery. Others mentioned applying tools that were un
familiar for the patients as a potential barrier. Affirming the causal
mechanisms in the most complex cases was mentioned as another
barrier. Our participants unanimously expressed that sufficient time
for anamnesis, quality communication and ensuring that their
message had been understood as intended was a key to obtain
therapeutic alliance. Moreover, the risk of too much information
and time spent as well as the challenge with patients dominated by
fear and pessimistic beliefs was acknowledged in the group. Time
has also been identified as a main barrier in a previous study, where
especially the support towards emotional disclosure were seen as
challenging in patients with high levels of distress (Cowell
et al., 2018). In our study, both the risk of going beyond your
competency, and the risk of compassion fatigue were expressed
as barriers for addressing possible psychological obstacles for
recovery.
4.1 | Strengths and limitations
The authors have aimed at thoroughness and transparency in plan
ning, implementation, interpretation, and reporting of the study. The
participants were recruited from the collaboration group in a quan
titative study and had volunteered to participate.
4.2 | Implications for physiotherapy practice
The physiotherapists in this focus group study expressed a shared
view that therapeutic alliance should build upon person‐centering,
motivational communication, and facilitation of lifestyle adjustments
within a biopsychosocial perspective of low back pain. Complex
clinical reasoning and close collaboration between patient and ther
apist was embraced as an integral part of practice. A humility was
expressed towards the fact that the optimal cause‐corrective treat
ment strategies were often not obvious. Time and tools to uncover
and modify relevant psychological obstacles for recovery were
perceived challenging and partly dependent on clinical experience.
Another recent study found that newly graduated physiotherapists
wanted accessible and individualized mentoring (Forbes et al., 2021).
This may imply that tools, techniques and procedures for address
ment of psychosocial obstacles for recovery should be included in
basic as well as postgraduate curriculums for physiotherapists.
Collaborative practice support strategies like peer guidance after
education, and better platforms for interprofessional collaboration
and decision support could contribute to improve practice in the
psychosocial domain.
