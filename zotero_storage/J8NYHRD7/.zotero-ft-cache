Abstract
Background: Due to gender inequities that exist for women of childbearing age,
there exists a need to deliver care tailored to their needs and preferences. Patient
centred care (PCC) can be used to meet these needs. This review aims to compare
patient care delivery between PCC and obstetrical care. This can help us address
how PCC should be delivered to women before, during and after pregnancy versus
how it is delivered to patients regardless of sex.
Methods: A review of literature was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL
and SCOPUS for English PCC and high‐quality perinatal reviews published between
2010 and 2021. The data were analysed using a modified Walker and Avant
framework.
Results: A total of 2138 unique studies were identified, with 11 PCC and 9 high
quality obstetrical care studies included. Common defining features between PCC
and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision‐making, ther
apeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. PCC
specific features were holistic care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated
care and empathy. Unique high‐quality obstetrical care themes included continuity
of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and status, physical en
vironment and equitable maternal care.
Conclusions: There are shared defining attributes between PCC and obstetrical care,
including respect and dignity, informed decision‐making, the therapeutic alliance,
effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. However, there remain
unique defining attributes for high‐quality obstetrical care and PCC. This highlights
the need for a unique approach to obstetrical care. More research on care for
different physiological conditions in women is needed to address patient care that
addresses different parts of the lifespan and develop frameworks that can influence
health policy, patient care and health system evaluation.
Patient or Public Contribution: This study was one part of a larger, multicomponent
study of how to implement PCC for women across the lifespan. While we did not

1 | INTRODUCTION
Patient‐centred care (PCC) was defined by the Institute of Medicine
as care that establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients
and their families to ensure that providers and systems deliver care
that is attentive to the needs, values and preferences of patients.1
Since then, considerable research has expanded our understanding of
PCC and how to achieve it. For example, a scoping review of
19 studies published from 1994 to 2011 identified 25 unique fra
meworks or models of PCC2 and several validated instruments with
which to measure PCC.3 Common elements of PCC include effective
communication, partnership and health promotion.2,3 Another review
of 28 reviews published between 2011 and 2017 identified a variety
of informational, educational and supportive interventions that can
be used to achieve PCC targeted at patients, family members or
providers.4 PCC is now widely recognized as a fundamental element
of high‐quality health care because it has been associated with nu
merous beneficial outcomes for patients (i.e., increased knowledge,
skill, satisfaction, quality of life; decreased admissions, readmissions
and length of hospital stay), family members (increased satisfaction;
decreased stress and anxiety) and provider (improved job satisfaction,
confidence and quality of care; reduced stress and burnout) out
comes across multiple settings, including primary, emergency, acute
and intensive care.4–6
Still, many patients do not receive or experience PCC. For ex
ample, a national survey in the United States showed that, among
2718 responding adults aged 40 years or older with 10 common
medical conditions, there was considerable variation in perceived
PCC among patients including involvement in discussing treatment
options and making decisions.7 Suboptimal PCC was reported by half
of 1794 American cancer survivors responding in 2013 to a national
survey.8 In 2016, a Commonwealth Fund national survey revealed
that fewer women reported patient‐centred communication with
their provider compared with the general population.9 Women con
tinue to experience gendered inequities in access to and the quality
of care in both developed and less developed countries,10,11 leading
to national and international appeals over several decades to improve
PCC for women.12–16 Despite evidence of inequities and appeals to
improve PCC for women, little research has identified how to pro
mote and support PCC for women. We conducted a theoretical rapid
review to describe how PCC was studied among women affected by
depression or cardiovascular disease, conditions with known gen
dered inequities.17 Our review identified a few studies of PCC among
women, and those studies failed to fully conceptualize or describe
PCC. We subsequently explored women's and clinicians' views about
what constitutes PCC,18 and generated recommendations by which
to achieve PCC for women.19
PCC could address gendered inequities by engaging women in
their care and tailoring care to their needs and values. Hence, further
research is needed to explore how to foster PCC for women with
different conditions or healthcare issues. Giving birth is one of the
most common reasons for inpatient hospitalisation, and the cost of
inpatient delivery is increasing over time despite declining pregnancy
rates.20 Quality of care during labour and birth affects maternal and
child morbidity and mortality, and is a concern worldwide.21 Factors
such as lack of coordinated care among providers, fragmentation of
care and substandard care also negatively influence patient‐centred
obstetric care.22 A systematic review of 47 studies on person‐centred
interventions in delivery facilities found that interventions aimed to
improve autonomy, supportive care, social support, health facility
environment and dignity, but the person‐centred objectives did not
match the PCC or clinical outcomes measured.23 The authors em
phasized this lack of theoretical coherence between aims and inter
vention design, given that interventions to improve quality of care are
more successful when selected and tailored according to pre
identified barriers and theory, which may lead to more thorough
measurement and evaluation of PCC in maternity care.24 Hence,
there is a need to more thoroughly conceptualize PCC in maternal
care to inform the development of interventions that improve the
quality of maternal care and of measures to assess their impact.
Primary research in maternity care has focused on the experi
ences of women in maternity care,25,26 goals of maternity care,27
interventions to improve quality of maternity care28 and outcomes of
high‐quality maternity care.29 However, few reviews have synthe
sized these elements, and no prior reviews mapped the domains of
high‐quality maternity care to PCC domains or a PCC framework. The
purpose of this study was to compare the concepts of PCC with
concepts of high‐quality inpatient obstetric care in published con
ceptual reviews. This would identify common elements and poten
tially PCC elements unique to the maternal care context by which to

plan and improve obstetrical care for women giving birth as
inpatients. This knowledge could be used by women's health
researchers, and also by clinicians, and healthcare managers and
policy‐makers to inform the planning, delivery and improvement of
healthcare services for women.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Approach
The main purpose of this review is to compare and contrast the
elements of PCC and high‐quality obstetrical care found in the lit
erature. To do so, we conducted a concept analysis, which is a
‘process of determining the likeness and unlikeness between con
cepts’30 that has been used by others to compare models of quality of
life31 and patient participation.32 More specifically, we used the
Walker and Avant30 concept analysis approach. Other approaches
such as the Rogers' evolutionary concept analysis or Haase's si
multaneous concept analysis built upon this model, but the Walker
and Avant model remains the approach most widely used.33 The
approach includes choosing a concept, determining the purpose of
analysis, identifying all uses of the concept, defining attributes,
identifying antecedents and consequences and defining empirical
referents. This provides a comprehensive understanding of each to
pic independent of each other as well as a comparison of the defining
attributes, antecedents, consequences and empirical referents that
are shared between these two topics. This was completed by con
ducting a review of literature between 2010 and 2021 for reviews
that examine patient care in PCC and obstetrical care. The two pri
mary objectives of this review are to (1) gain an understanding of how
PCC and obstetrical care has been conceptualized since 2010 and (2)
to compare the characteristics of patient care between these two
concepts. This will provide a foundation for PCC for women based on
the identified values and preferences of female patients in the
birthing process.
2.2 | Eligibility criteria
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria (File S1) were based on
persons/participants, issue/intervention, comparisons and out
comes.34 In brief, for the PCC concept analysis, the persons or par
ticipants were any patients aged 18+ or healthcare professionals in
any primary, secondary or tertiary setting of care. The interventions
were reviews that examine or describe elements and processes that
constitute person‐centred care. The comparisons were what partici
pants view as PCC or PCC barriers, or assess if PCC was delivered, or
evaluate PCC outcomes after an intervention, before and after an
intervention or compared between interventions. The outcomes
were views, beliefs or preferences, enablers, barrier or challenges,
interventions that promote or support PCC and impacts of PCC.
Reviews were excluded if they focused on a specific population or
clinical situation (e.g., palliative care, paediatric population,
emergency).
The high‐quality obstetrical care concept analysis included pa
tients 18+ receiving obstetrical or reproductive care during labour
and delivery or the perinatal period or healthcare professionals who
provide obstetrical care. The intervention was high‐quality perinatal
care. Comparisons were also performed on participant views, high
quality obstetrical care delivery, evaluation of perinatal outcomes
after an intervention, before and after an intervention or compared
between interventions. The outcomes were views, beliefs or pre
ferences, enablers, barriers or challenges, interventions that promote
or support high‐quality obstetrical care and impacts of high‐quality
care. Reasons for exclusion were if the reviews focused on a specific
aspect of obstetrical care outside the immediate labour and delivery
experience (antenatal care, breastfeeding, ectopic pregnancies or
termination).
2.3 | Search strategy
B. J. and K. D. searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS
databases on 29 March 2021. This included English syntheses of the
literature between the years of 2010 and 2021 for PCC and perinatal
care separately. Our preliminary searching revealed several existing
reviews on the topics of PCC and maternal care, so rather than in
cluding both primary studies and reviews, potentially resulting in
overlapping studies, we chose to include only reviews, as they re
present the totality of published information on a given topic (see File
S2 for the search strategy in MEDLINE). The search terms for PCC
studies included patient‐, client‐, family‐ and woman‐centred care.
Both American and British spellings were used and variations of
search terms with or without hyphens. The systematic review for
obstetrical studies included terms such as obstetric, birth, postnatal,
perinatal, labour and delivery to search for the obstetric reviews that
examine the labour process. This was combined with terms for
healthcare quality, quality improvement, patient satisfaction, quality
assurance, quality indicators, programme evaluation and
provider–patient relations. These results were limited to English
language reviews that are reviews of literature. A total of 2136 re
cords were exported from all databases once duplicates were
removed.
2.4 | Screening
B. J. and K. D. screened the titles and abstracts for articles that
fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Subsequently, B. J. and K. D. conducted
a more refined screening of full‐text articles that were relevant to the
PCC or obstetrical care. Articles were excluded if they were not re
views, focused on provider perspectives. Studies were also excluded
if they discussed concepts such as patient‐reported outcome (PRO)
measures, PROs, patient navigation, patient activation or specific
interventions or tools. Specific populations of uses or populations

were also excluded, such as end‐of‐life care, residential or long‐term
care, palliative care, emergency medicine, paediatric populations or
any other focused group. Studies that were clinically focused on the
illness rather than the care experience were not included. Articles
that mentioned PCC in the background or conclusion without ex
plicitly focusing on PCC were also excluded.
2.5 | Data extraction
K. D. and B. J. conducted a pilot data extraction that was reviewed by
A. R. G. to ensure consistency; author, year, country, study design,
findings and definitions of PCC or high‐quality obstetrical care. The
study design included the type of review, data range of the included
articles and number of articles included. Studies were not appraised
for quality.
2.6 | Data analysis
B. J. and K. D. first extracted direct quotations from the studies with
their primary results. The data were analysed by K. D. based on the
Walker and Avant domains, which were defining attributes, ante
cedents, consequences and empirical referents. Unique themes were
identified if they appeared across multiple studies or were significant
themes identified in the included studies. The identified defining at
tributes, antecedents, consequences and empirical referents were
reviewed with A. R. G. recursively before consolidating a final list. The
data were analysed first within PCC and obstetrical care in
dependently before comparing the overlap and unique elements of
the two concepts. The identified themes remained close to the
wording that was used by the studies. Themes that were very similar
in meaning, for instance, ‘unique to person’ and ‘individualized care’
or ‘autonomy’ and ‘ownership and control’, were combined into
one term.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Search results
The search yielded 2324 studies, and 188 duplicates were removed
(see Figure 1). A total of 119 full‐text articles were screened by B. J.
and K. D. Of these, 99 were excluded due to publication type (n = 27),
focus not being on PCC or perinatal quality of care (n = 26), not as
sessing interactions between patient and provider (n = 21), assessed
only a specific PCC or obstetrical intervention or application (n = 11),
did not focus on the target population (n = 10) and focused on illness
rather than care experience (n = 4). Ultimately, 20 studies were in
cluded, which consisted of 11 PCC and 9 high‐quality obstetrical care
reviews (refer to Table 1 for the characteristics of the included
studies).
3.2 | Study characteristics
A total of 11 PCC and 9 obstetrical care reviews were included.35–54
These were from the United States of America (n = 4), United King
dom (n = 3) and Australia, (n = 2), and one each from Canada,
Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, German, Tanzania, India, Europe,
Iran and South Africa. Studies were published from 2012 to 2021.

(n = 9), scoping review (n = 3), narrative review (n = 1) and qualitative
evidence synthesis (n = 1).
Of the nine high‐quality perinatal care reviews, six offered de
finitions related to respectful maternity care or woman‐centred care.
Only 4 of the 11 PCC reviews provided definitions of PCC.
3.3 | Defining attributes
High‐quality obstetrical care and PCC shared several common de
fining features including respect and dignity, informed decision‐making,
therapeutic alliance, effective communication, consideration of social
relationships and patient autonomy (see Figure 2). Definitions of
identified defining attributes were derived from the definitions used
in the included studies and can be found in File S3. Respect and dignity
was a theme in 73% of the PCC studies and 22% of the obstetrical
care studies. It was generally defined as affirming the patient choices
and perspectives, and in obstetrical care, this definition also extended
to freedom from harm and mistreatment. Informed decision‐making
was present in 36% of PCC studies, but was a much more prominent
theme of high‐quality obstetrical care, where 89% of the studies in
cluded it as a feature of obstetrical care. The therapeutic alliance
between the patient and provider was discussed in 55% of PCC and
11% of obstetrical care studies. Effective communication was a de
fining feature in 36% of PCC and 11% of obstetrical care studies.
Social relationships were especially important in obstetrical care,
where the presence of family or a labour companion influenced their
experience of labour. This was in 45% of PCC and 22% of obstetrical
care studies. Autonomy was a prevalent theme in both PCC and ob
stetrical care studies, with discussion in 45% and 44%, respectively.
Several PCC‐specific themes were identified, including holistic
care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated care and empathy.
Individualized care, which tailored care to the individual perspectives,
needs, values and beliefs of the patient, was present in all PCC stu
dies. Holistic care was present in 64%, empowerment in 27%, co
ordinated care in 11% and empathy in 55% of the PCC studies (see
Table 2).
Themes that were unique to high‐quality obstetrical care in
cluded continuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education
and status, physical environment and equitable maternal care. The
prevalence of these themes was 11% for continuity of care, 33% for
privacy and confidentiality, 22% for provider education and status, 22%
for physical environment and 22% for equitable maternal care (see
Table 3). Provider education and status referred to the education and
training that health providers receive and the perception of their own
role and status. Studies discussed the physical environment as having
access to hygienic facilities, quiet and private spaces and adequate
space for the labour and delivery process. Equitable maternal care was
defined as the availability of services to all pregnant women re
gardless of race, religion, ethnicity or cultural background.
On average, each PCC study incorporated 5.45 themes (median
of 5; range: 3–9). Each obstetrical study incorporated 3.11 themes
(median of 3; range: 1–6).

3.4 | Antecedents and consequences
Antecedents were generally broken down into patient factors, pro
vider qualities, organisational capacity, systematic factors and mutual
participation and communication for both PCC and obstetrical stu
dies. File S3 contains the specific antecedents identified in the lit
erature under each category.
In PCC studies, antecedents also included the need for health
care intervention and shared governance. Patient factors referred to
the capacity to engage in decision‐making. Provider qualities ranged
from vision and commitment, leadership, personal qualities of the
provider, interdisciplinary teamwork to knowledge and ability. Or
ganisational capacity included the physical environment, feedback,
access to resources and time and a culture that respects values and
choices. Systematic factors, which were present in 18% of the stu
dies, include health disparities and access to care.
The antecedents identified throughout the literature for ob
stetrical care included patient factors such as their choice predis
position, comfort in expressing preferences, adequate information
provision, previous experiences of labour and family/partner in
volvement. Similar to the obstetrical studies, organisation capacity
referred to the availability of resources, health infrastructure, health
financing, physical environment that allowed for privacy, care
guidelines and continuum of care. Evidence‐based care, quality
communication systems, social stability, and cultural sensitivity were
systemic factors.
Common consequences between the PCC and obstetrical studies
include patient satisfaction, knowledge and health literacy, improved
health outcomes and improved trust. Patient satisfaction was a
consequence in 64% of the PCC studies and 44% of the obstetrical
studies. Improved health outcomes were reported in 45% and 22% of
PCC and obstetrical studies, respectively. In PCC studies, improved
trust was identified in 36% of the PCC studies and in obstetrical care,
improved trust was identified in 22% of the studies. Knowledge and
health literacy was a consequence in 9% of PCC studies and 22% of
obstetrical care studies. PCC‐specific consequences include im
proved quality of care, provider satisfaction, patient engagement,
treatment adherence, empowerment and reduced healthcare re
source utilisation. Improved quality of care was commonly identified
in 64% of the PCC studies. Consequences that are unique to high
quality obstetrical care include respectful intrapartum care, self
efficacy, attitudes about future pregnancies and future relationship
with the child.
3.5 | Empirical referents
Empirical referents were not commonly identified in PCC or ob
stetrical care literature. Three PCC reviews listed empirical referents.
Tools that were listed to evaluate different domains of PCC include
The Consultation and Relational Empathy Scale, the Client‐Centred
Care Questionnaire, the Kim Alliance Scale, A Patient–Doctor
Relationship Questionnaire, the Stanford Trust in Physician Scale,
the Health Care Climate Questionnaire, Schmidt Perception of the
Nursing Care Survey, Person‐Centred Climate Questionnaire, the
Individualized Care Scale, the Patient‐Centred Inpatient Scale, Patient
Satisfaction with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire, Short
Form‐36 and Functional Independence Measurement. Only two
studies discussed possible empirical referents in the obstetrical care
studies, which included perinatal outcomes (preterm birth, perinatal
death), decisional regret scores and the Shared Decision‐Making
Questionnaire (SDM‐Q‐9).
Overall, there was significant overlap in the defining attributes
identified between PCC and obstetrical care with six common

themes. There were five PCC and six obstetrical unique themes.
Antecedents were commonly divided into patient factors, provider
factors, organisational capacity, systematic factors and mutual parti
cipation and communication. Few PCC and obstetrical care studies
listed empirical referents. In total, 13 PCC and 3 obstetrical empirical
referents were identified across the review.
4 | DISCUSSION
The aim of the review was to compare and contrast how care was
delivered to patients between PCC and obstetrical care based on a
Walker and Avant concept analysis. Common themes between PCC
and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision
making, therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social re
lationships and autonomy. There were unique elements to high
quality obstetrical care including continuity of care, privacy and
confidentiality, provider education and status, physical environment
and equitable maternal care. Two concept analyses were conducted
independently to synthesize the current literature for PCC and ob
stetrical care. There was significant overlap in the defining attributes,
antecedents and consequences. DeLabrusse et al.55 had cross
referenced PCC definitions with maternity care and found that one
model56 was inclusive of high‐quality maternity care, indicating that
there may be the applicability of some PCC models of care to high
quality maternity care. However, there were still a significant number
of themes that were unique to PCC and obstetrical care, indicating
that some aspects of high‐quality intrapartum care cannot be entirely
explained using a PCC framework. Many of the defining attributes
identified are similar to those found in other studies about PCC and
obstetrical health. For instance, the WHO quality of care framework
for maternal and newborn health also included dimensions such as
communication, respect and dignity and emotional support.57 This
also aligns with the current PCC interventions to improve the quality
of facility‐based delivery, which primarily pursued the PCC objectives
of autonomy, supportive care, social support, the health facility en
vironment and dignity.58
This review also highlighted several gaps in the understanding of
PCC and obstetrical care. Few reviews included definitions of PCC
and high‐quality maternity care. The several studies that did define
these concepts varied significantly, indicating that there is no unifying
definition for either concept yet in the literature. Indeed, despite the
large body of literature on PCC, there is no consensus on a definition
of PCC59 or maternity health.60 This study also revealed the lack of
empirical referents for assessing obstetrical care. While there were
many tools and validated scales for PCC, there were few that were
identified for high‐quality obstetrical care. The consequences for
high‐quality care tended to be more focused on newborn mortality,
maternal mortality and health outcomes rather than quantifying the
quality of maternity care. This indicates that there is a need for the
development of empirical referents for the quality of obstetrical care.
There are unique elements to obstetrical care, such as con
tinuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and
status, physical environment and equitable maternal care, as
identified in this study. This may be due to the unique needs of
women, particularly during childbirth. Previous literature on
patient‐centred care for women (PCCW) identified that women
more frequently prioritized exchanging information above other
domains.61 This is reflected in the results of this concept analysis,
as informed decision‐making was disproportionately identified as a
defining feature in obstetrical care studies in comparison to PCC
studies. Women experience unique health challenges that cannot
be approached in the same manner as other PCC interventions due
to ongoing gender disparities.62 However, another interpretation
is that prior research on perinatal care did not fully explore wo
men's needs, experiences and outcomes using a robust PCC fra
mework, as was used in this study, and may have missed
identifying key domains of high‐quality care. Therefore, ongoing
research may be needed to more fully explore obstetrical care with
a PCC lens. A modified Walker and Avant concept analysis was
used due to its purpose in ‘determining the likeness and unlikeness
between concepts’.30 This was demonstrated in this concept
analysis and fulfilled the aim of the study, which was to effectively
identify clear similarities and differences between obstetrical care
and PCC. A thorough comparison using this framework included
defining features, antecedents, consequences and outcomes. By
analysing or comparing high‐quality perinatal care to PCC, we
identified possible gaps in the way in which obstetrical care has
been studied.
Several strengths of this study include a comprehensive search of
multiple databases, compliance with the reporting of reviews63 and
appropriate application of a pre‐existing model of concept analysis.30
There were several limitations to this study. We did not search the
grey literature, which may have excluded several articles of interest
from the search. In addition, the studies that were included varied
widely from high‐income countries to low‐ and middle‐income
countries. The perspectives and priorities regarding maternity
health differ significantly across these different contexts. For in
stance, hygiene and mistreatment were common themes in low‐ and
middle‐income countries, but not in high‐income country studies. In
addition, the focus of the obstetrical care was specifically on the
perinatal period during the labour and delivery. This excluded other
periods of interest, such as antenatal care or postnatal care. We also
included the general delivery experience and excluded specific clin
ical situations, such as ectopic pregnancies and termination of preg
nancy. These situations may offer another perspective in terms of
high‐quality obstetrical care.
This study revealed several ideas for ongoing research. The re
sults of this concept analysis highlight the need for more high‐quality
studies evaluating the definition of high‐quality maternity care, par
ticularly with a PCC lens. There needs to be a more standardized
definition and model of care for both PCC and obstetrical care that is
widely applicable. This study has shown that there is a significant
intersectionality between the two concepts and that PCC models
may be applicable to aspects of maternity care. A more centralized
PCC model for women would need to take into consideration

different settings and conditions, including obstetrical care. This
study can help inform future changes to health system design, health
policy and healthcare delivery.
5 | CONCLUSION
There have been many studies that have reviewed PCC and high
quality obstetrical care as separate entities; however, there continues
to be variation in how PCC and high‐quality obstetrical care is de
fined. Our aim with this review was to present findings from reviews
on the concept of PCC and high‐quality obstetrical care since 2010 to
understand how they have been conceptualized. Furthermore, more
research is needed both within PCC and obstetrical health to orga
nize, define and categorize information related to women's health
care. A paradigm shift in women's health as a concept is essential to
deliver care that is more encompassing of the needs and priorities
of women in different aspects of their health and over the course of
their lifespan. With more research in care delivery for different
conditions for women, information on the preferences and needs of
female patients can be used to create a comprehensive and holistic
framework for PCCW. This framework can then be utilized in policy
and guideline development to effectively meet and address the needs
of female patients, or provide a female patient perspective to existing
guidelines that tend not to emphasize women's experiences.
