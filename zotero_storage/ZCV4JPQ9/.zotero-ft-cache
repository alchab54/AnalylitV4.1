ABSTRACT
Introduction: Postpartum depression (PPD) is common, persistent, and stigmatized. There are insufficient trained professionals to deliver appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Areas covered: WB001 is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) based Agent-Guided Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (AGCBT) program for the treatment of PPD, for which Breakthrough Device Designation was recently granted by the US Food and Drug Administration. WB001 combines therapeutic alliance, human-centered design, machine learning techniques, and established principles from CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT). We introduce AGCBT as a new model of service delivery, whilst describing Woebot, the agent technology that enables guidance through the replication of some elements of human relationships. The profile describes the device’s design principles, enabling technology, risk handling, and efficacy data in PPD. Expert opinion: WB001 is a dynamic and personalized tool with which patients may establish a therapeutic bond. Woebot is designed to augment (rather than replace) human healthcare providers, unlocking the therapeutic potency associated with guidance, whilst retaining the scalability and agency that characterizes self-help approaches. WB001 has the potential to improve both the quality and the scalability of care through providing support to patients on waiting lists, in between clinical encounters, and enabling automation of measurement-based-care.

1. Introduction
Postpartum depression (PPD) impacts approximately 10–20% of women worldwide [1]. PPD is characterized by a major depressive episode with peripartum onset – that is, symptom onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of delivery [2]. In contrast to a major depressive episode occurring outside of the peripartum phase and the milder ‘baby blues’ that typically resolve on their own within 2 weeks [3], PPD’s pervasive and persistent negative thoughts often focus on the infant and surrounding sequelae. For example, extreme worry about the infant may present at clinically significant levels [4], and intrusive thoughts about inadvertent and accidental potential harm to the infant are common [5]. Untreated PPD presents both immediate and longer-term risk of harm to both mother and infant [6]. In the United States, the estimated prevalence is about 1 out of 7 (14%) women, although rates vary by state and have been found as high as 1 out of 5 (20%) in certain states [7,8]. Given that PPD is often under-detected and under-diagnosed, such point prevalence rates are thought to grossly underestimate the actual impact of the illness. For example, among women within or outside the peripartum stage, almost 60% with depressive symptoms do not receive a clinical diagnosis and among those with a diagnosis, an estimated 50% of women do not receive any treatment [9]. Up to 70–75% of postpartum women may endorse mood and/or anxiety symptoms [10,11]. Over 80% had not reported their symptoms to any health professional [12].
Published recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [13] as well as the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [14], the American Psychiatric Association (APA) [15], and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [16] call for both early screening and treatment of PPD. In addition, the primary maternal care provider is recommended to have ongoing follow-up with the patient as needed [13,16]. Women should be screened early, at their first well-woman’s visit, for the presence of depression and anxiety, among other psychological concerns [13,16]. If a woman endorses an initial depression screening question, is at risk of developing a mental health problem, and/or has another clinical concern, then she is to be screened for PPD specifically (using either the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) or Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)) [17] as part of a full assessment and/or referred to her PCP. Severe mental health concerns indicate referral to a mental health professional [16]. Both ACOG and NICE outline that the first step should focus on identification and assessment and may include the supervising clinician requesting follow-up visits to the clinic while subsequent steps may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or when indicated, both [16,18].
APA, USPSTF, and NICE recommend evidence-based treatments including CBT and IPT [15], and indicate that psychotherapy without medication be considered as a potential

first-line treatment for women with major depression, mildmoderate degree, who are pregnant or breastfeeding [15].
2. Brief overview of the market
As stated previously, most women with symptoms of PPD do not report these to their healthcare professional [12]. Treatment-seeking women with PPD often select between psychotherapy alone, medications alone, or psychotherapy plus medications. Psychotherapy is a broad term used colloquially to reference different therapy types (i.e. cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), emotion focused therapy (EFT), etc.). Choice of treatment is often mitigated by knowledge about the illness and available options, perceptions of relative risk, and individual beliefs [19]. The PPD literature indicates that CBT and IPT are preferred psychotherapeutic approaches for women with mild-to-moderate PPD, whereas antidepressants have been recommended for more severe cases [20]. If recommended first-line psychotherapeutic treatments are ineffective, unavailable, or unacceptable to the patient, or if she has more severe symptoms, antidepressant drug therapy should be considered in addition to or in place of the psychotherapy [20]. A recent review noted that rates of antidepressant use during pregnancy have increased over the decades, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) the most commonly prescribed class and sertraline, citalopram, and fluoxetine the most commonly prescribed agents in that class [21]. Evidence favoring one SSRI over another in PPD is limited [3], but the evidence that does exist suggests relative safety of sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram during pregnancy and of sertraline, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine, as well as the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) nortriptyline, while breastfeeding [3,22]. In most cases, the benefits of antidepressant treatment for the mother and infant outweigh the risks [23]. In March 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first drug specifically for PPD in adult women, Zulresso TM (brexanolone), an intravenous neuroactive steroid [24]. This prescription-only drug requires 60 h of intravenous drug infusion during an inpatient hospitalization period. Due to potential side effects including excessive sedation, sleepiness, and sudden loss of consciousness during drug administration, a Risk Evaluation and Management
Strategy (REMS) is required. Distribution of brexanolone is thus restricted to certified healthcare facilities and the patient must be carefully monitored throughout the infusion. Patients are asked to avoid driving, operating machinery, and engaging in other dangerous activities until the treatment-induced feelings of sleepiness have resolved. They are also advised not to be the primary caregiver of any dependents (such as the newborn) during the infusion period. These disruptive and invasive requirements create significant barriers to use of this medication in new mothers, further compounded by COVID-19-related impacts on access to infusion centers. Interventions designed to be delivered by trained and supervised non-specialists in primary care and community settings have been developed to reduce the mental health treatment gap in low-resource communities. A 2017 review by Singla et al. found that interventions delivered face-toface in fewer than 10 sessions across 2–3 months by community health workers and peers that included elements of behavioral, interpersonal, emotional, and cognitive approaches had moderate to strong effects in reducing the burden of common mental health disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) [25]. Examples of psychological interventions for adults with mental health difficulties including depression in lowincome contexts experiencing healthcare provider shortages include Patel’s Healthy Activity Program (HAP) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Problem Management Plus (PM+) and Group Problem Management Plus (Group PM+). HAP is a brief, manualized intervention for depression derived from behavioral activation that can be delivered in multiple formats (e.g. face-to-face or telephone) and has been found to be effective, acceptable, and cost-effective [26]. WHO PM+ and Group PM+ programs are manualized, transdiagnostic interventions that employ aspects of CBT [27]. Psychological interventions have also been developed specifically for women in low-income settings to account for a shortage of healthcare workers. Rahman et al. (2008)’s Thinking Healthy Program (THP) is a multimodal approach that includes aspects of CBT aimed at identifying, modifying, and replacing maladaptive thinking to elevate women’s social status [28]. The Friendship Bench is a brief, individual problem-solving therapy intervention [29]. Examples of other interventions include a culturally adapted CBT-based group program teaching emotional self-management [30], a psychoeducation approach derived from IPT delivered in a supportive context [31], PPD-specific informational booklets supplemented with discussions with primary care nurses encouraging early help-seeking behaviors [32,33], a psychoeducational group with treatment adherence support and as-needed pharmacotherapy [34], and interventions developed by community action groups designed to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and, in turn, positively impact maternal mental health downstream [35]. A review indicates that these interventions, and others like them, can be effectively implemented by non-specialists in low-resource communities [36].

3. Introduction to the device
3.1. Mechanism: CBT, BA, and IPT for PPD
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been validated through rigorous research over several decades across severity levels of depression [37,38]; perinatal depression [39]; delivery modalities (individual, group, computer, smartphone [40–42]); and formats (traditional one-to-one in person with an advanced degreeholding expert, guided self-help with a non-advanced degreeholding coach [43]). The CBT model postulates a direct and reciprocal interaction between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that both help illuminate understanding of one’s overall emotional distress and situational responses as well as simultaneously highlight areas for intervention. Specifically, CBT intervenes on cognitions, mainly through challenging and changing automatic thinking patterns, and behaviors, primarily through behavioral activation [44]. A recommended CBT approach for PPD suggests inclusion of: psychological assessments, psychoeducation about CBT and PPD, regular mood monitoring, and practice with the CBT tools (i.e. thought challenging), including in between sessions [45]. One such CBT program is called ‘Mothers and Babies’ and it has garnered substantial evidence [46–48]. This program includes topics such as how to apply CBT tools to common maternalinfant issues in PPD such as bonding and coping with stressors [49]. This program reported improvements in PPD compared to control groups at both end of treatment (EOT) and follow-up; one study showed a 9% vs 33% PPD occurrence in treatment versus control groups at 3 months follow-up [50]. Behavioral Activation (BA) is another core element of CBT. Generally speaking, BA encourages participants to engage in positive pleasurable behaviors in order to manage and improve mood. It also actively addresses behavioral avoidance and other barriers to engaging in such behaviors using problem solving and alternative coping strategies. Goals for engaging in activities are generally incremental, building self-efficacy and mastery along the way. In its application to PPD, BA interventions may include activities with mother and child (potentially facilitating mother-child bond) and/or with other supportive individuals (potentially increasing social support), among other pleasurable activities such as other hobbies, values-driven pleasurable activities, and/ or self-care. BA has been found to be helpful in the treatment of PPD [39,51–55], including internet-delivered BA [54,55]. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) has demonstrated efficacy for and is a recommended intervention for depression [43] as well as PPD [56]. IPT is the formal name of a type of psychotherapy that works to alleviate clinical symptomatology specifically via improvement of interpersonal functioning [43]. It has demonstrated efficacy for and is a recommended intervention for depression as well as PPD [56,57]. IPT for depression is based on attachment and interpersonal theory [58] and postulates that the depressive symptomatology has biopsychosocial roots and is therefore in part consequences of interpersonal distress in one of four IPT defined problem areas including: role disputes, role transitions, grief, and interpersonal deficits. IPT for PPD mirrors this theoretical foundation and primarily focuses on role disputes, role transitions, and grief and loss [56]. Role disputes may address factors such as perceived or real lack of support from relationships and/or
criticisms she may be receiving regarding her infant care practices. Role transitions typically address shifts in identity, the decision of whether or not to return to or begin work outside of the home, and difficulties navigating social obligations. Last, grief and loss focus on the loss of an infant, miscarriage, or caring for a medically ill infant. There may also be grief work around the mother’s experience of how she was parented or raised. In addition to the problem areas, IPT for PPD incorporates specific attention to areas highly pertinent to mothers of infants including but not limited to physical recovery, sleep disruption, and decreased energy. Relationships of emphasis in the therapy include that between the woman and her infant, partner, family of origin, partners family of origin, and friends. This accumulation of evidence is demonstrated by the National Institutes of Clinical Excellence’s recommendation of CBT and IPT as psychological treatments of choice for depression (NICE) [57].
3.2. Delivery: agent-guided CBT (AGCBT)
Here, we describe a version of ‘Agent-guided CBT’ (AGCBT) developed specifically for PPD, named WB001, which enlists a conversational or relational agent (i.e. software that utilizes natural language processing to create an interface that emulates human discourse, and elements of human relationships) [59]. Research on CBT has demonstrated the efficacy of digital methods of delivery (e.g. online learning/internet delivered interventions) to reduce symptoms of depression at posttreatment and follow-up [60]. There is now a significant body of research that supports mobile mental health applications, further supported by published research validating this method for delivery of CBT such that they form part of the best practice guidelines of several professional societies such as the UK National Health Service’s Mental Health Implementation Plan [61] and the American Psychiatric Association’s App Advisor Initiative [62]. WB001 is an 8-week digital therapy comprising a mobile patient application intended to deliver CBT and some elements of IPT to women who have recently given birth, in order to reduce the symptoms associated with PPD. WB001 is unique because it uses a person-centered design approach with evidence-based techniques from CBT and IPT to guide women toward symptom management in real time. Furthermore, it is the only medical device specifically designed to optimize exposure to the active ingredients of these therapies through both engagement and relational strategies. To a greater degree than professionally delivered psychotherapy or even pharmacological interventions, it is a much more scalable technology to reduce the burden of postpartum depression, given the very small incremental resources involved in treating each additional marginal user. By designing specifically for the nuance of the PPD experience, WB001 maximizes exposure to these evidence-supported treatment elements, increasing motivation and efficacy in a safe and noninvasive way. The patient selects key areas she would like to work on from the following list which was curated and refined via a human-centered design process: Bonding with my Baby, Feeding, Feeling Inadequate, Depression & Sadness,
EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES 1037


Frustration, Feeling Overwhelmed, Loneliness, My identity, Relationships, Sleep, Stress & Anxiety, and ‘Other stuff’. Patients may choose as many, or as few problem areas as they wish. WB001, delivered through the trusted relational agent ‘Woebot’ optimizes for sustained engagement throughout the treatment by first establishing rapport, then demonstrating understanding of the patients’ experience through provision of carefully crafted empathic statements, and demonstrating credibility by tailoring conversations based on pertinent information gleaned from previous conversations (analogous to clinical memory). Examples of Woebot’s clinical memory include push notifications that encourage the patient to ‘check-in’ embedded with reference to these specific patient-selected target topics. WB001 also recognizes if a patient has already discussed one of these areas and will offer another topic, based on the patient’s independent ranking of these concerns. WB001 also asks what type of feeding method the postpartum mother primarily uses with her baby, with options including breastfeeding, a combination of breast and formula feeding, and formula feeding only. Later, if and when a patient indicates that she is having emotional concerns regarding feeding her baby, WB001 offers evidence-based emotional support tools with content specific to her selected feeding method – an important customization feature, given that concerns about feeding can differ profoundly depending on how a mother is choosing to feed her child. In addition, if a patient indicates that she is having trouble feeding but has switched methods from the one she originally chose, WB001 will also recall this information so that in the future, she is offered again the most relevant content. Indeed, WB001 Woebot has the ability to understand whether a shared issue is new or ongoing for a patient, comment on previous conversations, and escalate and diversify the psychotherapeutic tools or other content offered. The patient experience of WB001 is centered around mood tracking and goal-oriented, tailored conversations; the very essence of the experience uses conversational tones. Patients become familiar with Woebot, which is a friendly, helpful character that is explicitly not a human, nor a therapist. The Woebot character has been designed with a ‘personality’ to facilitate a working alliance over time. Daily push-notifications prompt users to ‘check-in.’ Then, upon opening the app, Woebot asks them how they are feeling (Figure 1) and why they are feeling this way. Depending on the answer, Woebot offers mood-congruent content with pre-scripted response buttons for user input to simulate a familiar, engaging conversation. Based on the mood and problem classification that the user selected or entered, Woebot provides an emotion and problem-specific empathic response and then, depending on user choice, guides them through a lesson from a psychoeducational curriculum if their mood is positive or neutral, or, if they report negative mood, gently guides them step-by-step through evidence-based mood management tools. Woebot guides patients through the utilization, application, and practice of tools and processes for emotion management
drawn from evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions including cognitive restructuring; behavioral activation; emotional labeling and emotion regulation; distress tolerance; and mindfulness. Additional interpersonally focused mechanisms include mother-infant bonding; interpersonal communication analysis and communication skills building; and affective processing of role transitions. We refer to this process, rule set, and conversational design approach as an ‘Empathy Engine.’ WB001’s functionality was designed specifically for a PPD population and is a way of capturing and reflecting patient endorsed mood and event information with the aim of delivering the right content, to the right person, at the right time. Namely, the conversational components deployed – empathy, normalization, invitation to work on the emotional concern, and choice of method among evidence-based tools offered – vary by type of concern endorsed (Figure 2). In addition to the target problem areas, WB001 also offers 31 core PPD psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapy-based tools. The subject matter is derived from interviews with clinical experts, who are advanced degree holding (PhD, PsyD, MD) and licensed professionals (psychologists and/or psychiatrists) with active clinical practices and specific domain expertise in depression and/or postpartum depression. These clinical experts liaise with Woebot Health content writers who mold the critical elements of the subject matter provided by the experts into Woebot-delivered text-based conversational material in a manner consistent with Woebot’s conversational tones and style. The conversations are then again reviewed by the clinical experts to ensure the integrity of the therapeutic element has been captured thoroughly and edits are made as needed. By facilitating the repeated practice of mood monitoring, mood management techniques, and the delivery of psychoeducational resources, WB001 delivers a CBT and IPT intervention that addresses the symptoms associated with PPD. Primarily a rules-based system, the conversational flow follows a tree-based structure with a short set of predefined button replies from which the user can choose. Although the majority of user inputs are pre-scripted selections, some proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms allow Woebot to understand natural language inputs as answers to specific questions. Woebot’s character was created to embody all of the values and underlying principles with which the agent conducts guided self help. For example, Woebot’s ‘belief’ that humans are dynamic and constantly changing – and that everybody experiences distorted thinking sometimes – are examples of beliefs that not only communicate how Woebot delivers care (i.e. being agnostic to diagnosis) but are also inherently destigmatizing. The Woebot character is the interaction device that imparts these, sets expectations, and allows users to intuitively decide whether or not to engage. According to recent systematic reviews of the literature, these values are an essential component of how the therapeutic bond is formed [63,64]. Woebot feels like a ‘someone,’ rather than an interface. Users get to know

Woebot as an endearing, curious, and wise character that presents as a peer, does not assume to know everything, is accepting of mistakes, and has a growth mind-set (Figure 3). While research suggests [65] that when assistants are given female gender they are considered more helpful and empathic, and when assistants mirror the demographics of the user they are generally viewed more positively, we decided instead to use a classic robot archetype as the agent’s appearance. This enables the character to be gender neutral and without race or ethnicity and to ensure the user is never in any doubt that they are talking to an AI.
3.3. Intended use, dose and course
WB001 is intended to reduce the symptoms associated with PPD by providing cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). WB001 is an 8-week treatment indicated as an adjunct to clinician supervised outpatient care management – which includes follow-up visits, medication, psychotherapy, or some combination thereof for women aged 22 years or older with mild-moderate
postpartum depression (Table 1). Although the U.S. FDA has not yet cleared WB001 as a prescription digital therapeutic, it is intended to be a prescription-only treatment added to rather than replacing – existing outpatient clinical care. During an active treatment phase, the device is designed for daily or almost daily use for around 5–10 min per session for approximately 8 weeks, or until such time that symptoms have been significantly reduced and the individual is ready to stop or pause treatment. Internal data suggest a doseresponse effect such that greater active days are positively associated with symptom reduction. Optimal usage is interactions on 3–5 days per week. This will be further elucidated in future research.
3.4. Safety
Our policy and processes in response to safety concerns are guided by a range of ethical frameworks including the professional codes of practice of mental health professionals such as the American Psychological Association (APA), e.g. respect for

the rights and dignity of the person, competence, assessment, privacy, confidentiality. When users first register for Woebot, but before the first conversation with Woebot begins, the user is guided through app-onboarding during which the limitations of the service are clarified. These specified limitations include that Woebot it is not a replacement for medical intervention nor a suicide prevention or crisis intervention service. In addition, this apponboarding indicates how to get access to crisis resources in the app (e.g. by typing ‘SOS’ in any open text field). Additionally, NLP techniques are used to evaluate any free text entered by users that might suggest a crisis situation (e.g. language suggesting suicidality, homicidality, etc.). If this ‘Safety Net’ detects such text, Woebot will prompt the user to confirm whether or not they are indeed in a crisis situation. If confirmed, Woebot informs the user that this is beyond the app’s capabilities and immediately provides a professionally curated list of crisis resources. As with any mental health tool or treatment, there is a risk that a user may not receive a higher level of care when it is needed. Woebot’s SOS and ‘Safety Net’ functions are intended to help the user identify such situations and facilitate access to care. Furthermore, after a user has received the curated list of resources, Woebot will also offer to help that person address their distressing emotion and/or thoughts in the moment via an evidence-based therapeutic technique. Then, at the subsequent check-in, Woebot will follow up and ask the user how they are doing given that they were in a difficult place during the previous interaction. Internal data suggest that 92% of
users never enter any information that would trigger a safety alert. The device is intended to be prescribed for women who are experiencing PPD following a live birth. Although the device will recognize an event described as death and loss and offers some grief content based on IPT, WB001 was not built as an intervention for fetal nor infant demise specifically. In this tragic instance, the treating clinician can advise discontinuation, and subsequent uninstall, of the device, and refer the mother to another resource that is able to address this clinically complex situation more thoroughly.
4. Clinical profile and post-marketing findings
4.1. Data from pre-FDA clearance studies
Prototypes of Woebot have been developed and studied in young adult depression [66], postpartum depression (PPD) [67], and substance use disorder (SUD) [68]. This work provided early evidence of Woebot’s efficacy as well as rapid establishment of a therapeutic bond comparable to that of a human therapist [69]. The earliest prototype of Woebot was developed to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program, derived from CBT principles, in college students who self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety [66]. In this unblinded RCT, participants aged 18–28 years (n = 70) were randomized to receive Woebot (n = 34) or an e-book

on depression (n = 36) published by the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Assessments occurred at baseline and at a second time point 2 to 3 weeks later. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated that participants in the Woebot group had significantly reduced symptoms of depression per the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) over the study period (F1,48 = 6.03; p = .017), whereas those in the control group did not (Figure 4), representing a moderate between-groups effect size (d = 0.44). In an analysis of completers, both groups exhibited significant reductions in anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54 = 9.24; p = .004). Baseline mean (standard deviation) GAD-7 scores were 19.4 (4.7) for the information-only group and 17.6 (4.6) at follow-up; in the Woebot group GAD-7 scores were 17.8 (5.9) at baseline and 16.8 (5.8) at follow-up. Study retention was high at 83%. Woebot’s ability to establish human-level bond with users was measured with the bond subscale score of the Working Alliance Inventory – Short Revised (WAI-SR), administered through the app’s conversational interface with the word ‘therapist’ replaced by ‘Woebot.’ [69] This retrospective analysis of data from 36,070 Woebot users aged 18–78 years demonstrated that, within 5 days of using Woebot, they reported a WAI-SR bond subscale score of 3.84 (SD 1.0),
which is comparable to that reported in recent studies of traditional outpatient individual and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4.0 and 3.8, respectively). Thus, contrary to the notion that the therapeutic relationship is exclusive to human-to-human interactions, these results suggest that it is possible for digital therapeutics to establish a therapeutic bond with users (Figure 5). Because rates of PPD diagnosis and treatment in the United States vary significantly by race and ethnicity [77–79], qualitative ethnographic research methodology was employed in the human-centric design, development, and early user testing of WB001. Ethnographic interviews of postpartum people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, and sexual orientation backgrounds were conducted in order to include program elements applicable to different populations. In addition, subject matter was garnered from interviews with clinical experts with active clinical practices and specific domain expertise in depression and/or postpartum depression. A later prototype of WB001 developed for postpartum mood management was assessed for acceptability and satisfaction in an RCT of 192 women ≥18 years old recruited within 72 h of giving birth during the delivery hospitalization [67]. Eligible participants were randomized either to receive Woebot plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. The

reported medium or high degrees of therapeutic alliance and acceptability (WAI-SR ≥ 24). WB001+TAU participants had significantly larger improvements in PHQ-9 depression scores as compared to a TAU-only control group (p = .025) between delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. Baseline mean (standard

Means and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for working alliance bond scores from this study and from recent reviews of the literature [70–76] are stratified by the week that the scores were recorded. Studies are colored based on the therapeutic modality. Due to the large sample size of this study (N=36,070), the 95% CI is narrow and overlaps with the dots that display the estimated means. For multiple studies that reported data on the same week, the dots are shifted minimally on the x-axis to avoid overlap and to provide easy readability.

deviation) PHQ-9 and EPDS scores were 4.41 (4.29) and 5.51 (4.70) for the Woebot arm, 3.36 (3.05) and 5.37 (4.20) for the TAU-only arm. At 6-week survey, mean PHQ-9 and EPDS scores were 3.09 (3.02) and 4.88 (5.26) for the Woebot arm, 3.23 (3.84) and 4.61 (5.20) for the TAU-only arm. Of the 68 users who completed the 6-week survey, 74% reported using the chatbot at least once every 2 weeks over the study period. Woebot has also been successfully adapted for adult substance use (W-SUD) as demonstrated in an open-label 8-week trial of participants aged 18–65 (n = 101) who screened positive on the self-reported questionnaire ‘Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener-Adapted to Include Drugs’ (CAGE-AID ≥2) [75]. For participants who completed the study (n = 51), confidence to resist urges to use substances (as measured by the Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire) significantly increased (p < .001). They also reported (Figure 6) significant decreases in past month substance use occasions, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test – Concise (AUDIT-C), 10-item
Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), PHQ-8, GAD-7, and cravings scale (all p ≤ .02). Over two-thirds of participants were mostly or very satisfied overall per CSQ-8 (36/51, 71%). Given the increases in substance use observed during the COVID-19 pandemic [80,81], Woebot also studied the association between various stressors and problematic substance use [82]. In a sample of adults (N = 180) with problematic substance use (CAGE-AID ≥2) who were recruited online from June to August 2020, those who reported struggling with responsibilities at home, greater mental health impacts, greater personal growth, frequenting bars or large gatherings, and greater depression (PHQ8) or anxiety (GAD-7) during COVID-19 had higher scores on the 15-item Short Inventory of Problems – Alcohol and Drugs (SIP-AD; all p < .05). Greater mental health effects were associated with higher SIP-AD, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 scores (all p < .02). An RCT conducted in this cohort randomized them to receive 8 weeks of W-SUD or a wait-list control [68]. At baseline, past-use substance use occasions for the entire sample was 30 (SD 19). At

Clinical Trial Population
Trial Type (N, status) Summary of outcomes
Fitzpatrick et al. 2017 [66] Young adults 18–28 years old self-reporting depression and anxiety
RCT (N=70, Complete)
This RCT among N=70 adults aged 18–28 years old found that participants randomized to Woebot had significantly greater reductions in depression at 2-weeks post-treatment compared to participants in the psychoeducational digital control group (F1,48=6.03; p=.017). RCT results indicated that Woebot was a feasible, effective, and engaging way to deliver CBT digitally. Ramachandran et al. 2020 [67]; Suharwardy et al. 2023 [83]
Postpartum women ≥18 years old
RCT (N=192, Complete)
Among a diverse (nearly 50% non-white), non-clinical sample of N=192 women who had recently given birth, the use of WB001 was acceptable and feasible for use in the early postpartum period. There was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in mean change scores from baseline to 6-weeks for PHQ-9 (WB001+TAU group mean difference −1.32 [SD 3.4]; control group mean difference −0.13 [SD 3.01]; p-value =.025. However, baseline PHQ-9 scores were subclinical in this sample: (WB001+TAU mean 4.41 [SD 4.29]; control mean 3.36 [SD 3.05]). Prochaska et al. 2021a [75] Adults 18–65 years old reporting substance use
Open-label, single arm (N=101, Complete)
A single arm open label pilot of Woebot for substance use disorders demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among a sample of N=101 adults (mean age = 36.8 years (SD 10.0). Among N=51 with complete data, at 8-weeks post-treatment, significant improvements were observed in substance use occasions (mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001), confidence to resist urges to use substances (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), depression (PHQ-8 mean change −2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005) and anxiety (GAD-7 mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001) scores. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (80%). Prochaska et al. 2021b [68] Adults 18–65 years old reporting substance use
RCT (N=180, Complete)
This RCT among N=180 adults found that relative to a wait-list control, participants randomized to receive Woebot for substance use disorders had significantly greater reductions in substance use occasions at 8-weeks post-treatment (Woebot group mean change = −9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. Wait-list mean change = −3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Reductions in substance use occasions were associated with fewer substance use problems as well as improved mental health, including depression and anxiety scores. Satisfaction with the Woebot program was high. Results indicated that experiencing worsened mental health symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with more substance use problems as well as depression and anxiety symptoms.

study completion, W-SUD participants demonstrated significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (Figure 7) relative to wait-list participants (mean decrease 9.1 [SE 2.0] vs. 3.3 [SE 1.8], p = .039). This study aimed to recruit a participant population analogous to US census data and was able to enroll a sample that selfidentified as 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white (13% Hispanic/ Latinx; 12% Black; 6% Asian American; 2% American Indian or Alaskan Native), 30% with high-school degree as highest level of education. This sample rated 96% of completed lessons positively and 88% would recommend the program to a friend with similar needs. There was also high study retention with 84% of the sample completing the post-treatment assessment. Woebot has also been adapted for adolescent depression. In a presently unpublished study by our group, after removing unauthorized duplicate users, Woebot significantly improved depression scores relative to a digital psychoeducational control group, as measured by PHQ-8 at 4 weeks post-treatment, in a diverse sample of N = 183 16–17 year olds who self
presented with mild-moderate depression (p < .001, two-sided t-test). Reported gender identity was 61.7% female, 23.0% male, 9.8% non-binary, 3.8% transgender man, 1.1% genderqueer, 0.5% another gender identity. Reported race was 62.8% white, 14.2% Asian American; 9.3% Black/African American, 2.2% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 5.3% multiracial, 3.8% another race. Reported ethnicity was 18% Hispanic/Latinx. Over 50% reported being non-heterosexual. Participants were recruited between August 2 and 12 September 2021 with the final participant completing the study 15 November 2021. The rapid recruitment rate suggests a potentially broad audience of teens interested in digitally delivered treatment for depressive symptoms. The device has been developed with a US population in mind initially, though the manufacturer is actively engaged in projects that explore distribution of adjacent products to individuals in emerging markets. These studies demonstrate that Woebot can rapidly establish a human-level therapeutic bond
Table 3. Alternative devices and therapies.
Description Pros Cons
Pure self-help Independent use of a treatment manual or protocol, following step-by-step instructions through a book or web-based system [84]
Cheap, scalable, brief, no reliance on trained human practitioners, empowering, accessible
Poor and superficial engagement and early treatment course termination, no scope for safety monitoring, not tailored or reactive, no personalization Face-to-face individual therapy/ counselling
Psychotherapy offered by a variety of professionals with different health backgrounds and varying levels of qualification (or none at all), typically faceto-face and based on eclectic approaches
Empathy, deep rapport, some excellent practitioners
Implementation is not consistent (‘researchpractice gap’) i.e. only ~ 50% of doctoral level clinicians are practicing manualized therapies as opposed to improvising. Inherently not scalable, efficient, readily available, or affordable. Remote video conferencing individual therapy
Use of clinical-grade (e.g. Amwell, VA Video Connect) or consumer-grade technology (e.g. Zoom, WebEx, Skype) to enable face-to -face therapy to take place virtually
Convenient for the individual, relatively more accessible and scalable (albeit still limited to the ratio of those interested: those available to treat)
Access and comfort with technology, privacy, security, data allowance, clinician reimbursement (particularly for Medicare and Medicaid), digital divide [85] Remote textbased individual therapy
Decentralized matchmaker service between users and professionals with varying levels of qualification delivering psychoeducational content, text, audio, and video
Convenient for the individual, discreet, responses from a real human, opportunity for licensed therapists to provide remote services, may be provided free of charge by employer
Privacy concerns [86], licensing [87], expectation mismatches between users and therapists [86], limited evidence for effectiveness, boundaries [86]
Pharmacological treatment
Oral antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); intravenous brexanolone for postpartum depression (PPD) [88]; intravenous ketamine for treatmentresistant depression (TRD); intranasal esketamine for TRD in conjunction with an oral antidepressant [89,90]
Demonstrated efficacy and safety; some oral antidepressants widely available at low cost and recommended as first-line therapy by a number of professional organizations; ketamine, esketamine, and brexanolone are rapid-acting; FDA approval for a variety of mental health indications (although intravenous ketamine use for TRD is offlabel)
Modest efficacy of oral antidepressants [91]; significant variability across therapies [92,93]; side effects; oral antidepressants can require 6–8 weeks to show efficacy and often are taken chronically; intravenous agents have complex administration requirements; cost; significant risks of bias in the evidence base [94] Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
Neuromodulation modalities such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
Relatively rapid-acting (especially as compared to oral antidepressants); discrete treatment course with opportunity for retreatment as indicated; TMS FDA-cleared for MDD [95] and OCD [96]; ECT traditionally had ‘grandfathered’ FDA approval but recently reclassified [97,98]
Stigma; time commitment (generally 5 treatments a week for TMS or 2–3 treatments a week for ECT, delivered over 4–6 weeks); requires specialized equipment and operator training; side effects
Group interventions
Offered or facilitated by a range of volunteers, former patients, or health-care professionals [99]. Includes courses such as Mamás y Bebés/Mothers and Babies [49,100].
Greater efficiency than individual therapy, reduces stigma, non-judgmental, not restricted to English language. May be superior to home visitation programs [101]. Can be adapted to internet formats [102].
Variable staff training and knowledge, limited insurance coverage and/or governmental support. Limited efficacy data, especially for moderate or severe presentations. Home visitation programs
Accepted component of postpartum care, especially in low-income populations, and includes adaptation of Mothers and Babies to 1:1 delivery [101].
Less patient burden, not restricted to English language.
Variable staff training and knowledge, limited insurance coverage and/or governmental support. Geographic limitations. Reduced availability secondary to COVID. Unclear efficacy and inconsistent meta-analytic findings [103].

with users, has high user satisfaction, and has promising early efficacy in diverse populations. Development continues; completed clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. The resulting data are expected to support an application for FDA clearance.
4.2. Alternative devices and therapies
Table 3. outlines alternative therapeutic approaches and devices for the treatment of PPD.
4.3. Regulatory status
Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) was granted by the US FDA 7 May 2021 for WB001 but no regulatory clearance/ approval has been granted at the time of writing.
5. Conclusion
PPD is a leading cause of distress among women, with challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management. The very nature of the condition means that many potential patients will not present appropriately to healthcare professionals, and when they do so the range of treatments on offer may not be suitable for their needs. The novel WB001 AGCBT product offers patients with PPD a personalized relational agent that can be used at a time and place of their choosing, with evidence-based interventions delivered in an empathetic and non-judgmental way. A range of usercentered design approaches and technologies allow personalized approaches to safe and effective treatment that go beyond the capabilities of existing alternatives on the market.
6. Expert opinion
The changes wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice have rapidly accelerated the adoption of new technologies for the effective provision of healthcare and research [104]. Whereas once remote sensing, telemedicine services, and decentralized clinical trials were relatively niche applications in clinical practice and research, regulators such as the US FDA and European Medicines Agency have encouraged their rapid adoption and uptake globally [104,105]. The experience of women giving birth during this turbulent time has been one of increased PPD symptoms [106] paired with a decrease in the availability of psychological services. PPD also presents unique treatment challenges, such as concerns about infant exposure to pharmacological agents via breastmilk or taking a new mother’s time and attention away from the baby. The stigma, judgment, and high expectations around society’s views of a ‘good mother’ can act as significant barriers to seeking face-to-face therapy. AGCBT is a feasible method of digitally disseminating the significant promise of CBT while minimizing the potential for stigma. In this review, we highlight the approach, methods, design, and clinical evaluations of Woebot, a novel AGCBT tool that can be accessed through a patient’s smartphone and is available 24 h a day, 7 days a week. The tool uses evidence-based best practices to deliver personalized treatments in line with the patient’s goals, has a favorable safety
profile, and goes beyond general mental wellness tools such as mindfulness or meditation by incorporating PPD-specific psychoeducation matched to the user’s individual goals and needs. As a piece of software, the advantages of a more scalable digital approach to treating PPD include the relative ease with which additional patients can be treated at high volumes, continual improvement of treatment approaches in the context of a quality management system, cultural and language localization, and consistency of treatment in a space characterized by eclectic approaches. However, caution must be taken to ensure that the ‘digital divide’ of those with access to smartphones and reliable high-speed internet connections do not further entrench existing inequalities. The manufacturer is committed to making mental health tools more accessible to marginalized groups. Continued research efforts are underway with clinical partners to identify potential improvements in the system, to validate the safety, acceptability, and efficacy of WB001, and to characterize the most appropriate users of the device. Inevitably the services that support women in the peri- and post-partum period will need adjustment to best support the deployment of adoption of such approaches. We remain hopeful that the promise of relational technologies to support patients in their darkest moments will become an important part of care and healing in the years to come.
