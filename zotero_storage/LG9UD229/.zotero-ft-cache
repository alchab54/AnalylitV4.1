Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and pattern recognition. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses specifically on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. This distinction is crucial in understanding how AI technologies, including Machine Learning, are transforming various fields, particularly in healthcare and rehabilitation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) including Machine learning has rapidly become integral to healthcare, with rehabilitation emerging as a field that stands to benefit significantly from its data-driven capabilities. By utilizing algorithms capable of analyzing extensive datasets, AI enables clinicians to identify patterns in patient progress, predict treatment outcomes, and personalize interventions to suit individual needs. This approach aligns well with the shift toward patient-centered care in modern healthcare, where AI acts as a key tool in creating precise, adaptive, and responsive treatment plans.1 Research consistently demonstrates that AI’s ability to process vast amounts of data enhances the accuracy and personalization of rehabilitation.2 For instance, literature on AI in physical therapy and rehabilitation report improvements in patient adherence to treatment and recovery timelines due to tailored, data-informed intervention plans.3 AI’s role in real-time monitoring is also highlighted in recent studies, which indicate that wearable devices and sensor technologies allow for continuous tracking of patient activity, providing rehabilitation professionals with insights
that help optimize therapy plans dynamically.4 A systematic review on wearable AI devices in healthcare shows the effectiveness of these tools in capturing essential patient metrics, allowing adjustments to be made in response to real-time data.5 Furthermore, predictive analytics----another key application of AI in rehabilitation----enables clinicians to anticipate potential treatment outcomes and adjust interventions preemptively, reducing the likelihood of setbacks. Systematic reviews emphasize that AI’s predictive capabilities are especially beneficial in managing chronic conditions and complex rehabilitation cases, as it empowers therapists to refine approaches based on individual risk factors and likely responses.6 AI are also instrumental in addressing gaps in rehabilitation services, such as limited access in rural or underserved areas. Tele-rehabilitation platforms powered by AI can facilitate remote monitoring and continuous care, making rehabilitation more accessible.7 Moreover, AI applications in rehabilitation extend beyond physical recovery; cognitive and emotional rehabilitation can be enhanced through tools such as virtual reality (VR) and AI-driven cognitive training systems.8 The intersection of AI, rehabilitation, and patient-centered care is poised to revolutionize the field, offering a more dynamic, efficient, and patient-tailored approach to rehabilitation. In this review, we will explore the core applications of AI in rehabilitation, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, and future directions. This exploration aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI is reshaping rehabilitation practices and to encourage further research into the transformative possibilities these technologies offer.

The role of AI and machine learning in rehabilitation: key applications
1. Personalized treatment plans:
AI algorithms are revolutionizing the personalization of rehabilitation programs. By analyzing patient-specific data, such as medical history, real-time performance metrics, and recovery progress, AI can tailor treatment plans that cater to individual needs. For instance, machine learning models can assess how a patient is responding to therapy and recommend adjustments to their exercises, intensity, or duration to optimize recovery. Studies indicate that AI-based treatment personalization improves patient engagement and accelerates recovery.3 AI can predict the likely progression of rehabilitation for different types of patients, including those with chronic conditions or neurological impairments, enabling therapists to make informed, data-driven decisions. A review highlighted that machine learning models can enhance patient outcomes by adapting rehabilitation plans to specific patient profiles.3,9
2. Predictive analytics
Predictive analytics is transforming rehabilitation by enabling practitioners to make more accurate forecasts regarding a patient’s recovery journey and potential complications. Through machine learning algorithms, predictive models analyze patient-specific data (such as demographics, health history, and prior recovery outcomes) alongside vast datasets from previous cases to make personalized predictions. This information helps therapists to anticipate recovery milestones, adjust treatment plans proactively, and even identify risks of complications, leading to a more effective, customized care approach.10 Research highlights that AI-driven predictive analytics enhance care by allowing early detection of risks, enabling interventions that can prevent complications and improve recovery outcomes. In orthopedics, for example, these predictive tools have been shown to support more precise planning for patient recovery by identifying risk factors in real time and helping tailor therapeutic interventions accordingly. Overall, predictive analytics contributes to a customized, data-informed approach to rehabilitation that maximizes patient engagement and optimizes outcomes,

These robotic devices support task-specific, repetitive movement training----key elements for motor skill recovery in neurorehabilitation. While robotic therapy offers promising advancements, evidence suggests it performs comparably to conventional therapy in certain areas Rehabilitation robots range from devices assisting limb movements to wearable exoskeletons, enhancing patient participation and optimizing rehabilitation outcomes through consistent practice. Research indicates that robotic-assisted therapies improve motor function and patient engagement compared to conventional approaches.14 For example, upper-limb robotic devices, designed to facilitate arm and shoulder movements, allow patients to practice fine motor tasks with greater accuracy.15 Rehabilitation robots are classified into various types, each designed to support different aspects of movement recovery. Exoskeletons are wearable devices that provide structural support, enabling patients with conditions like lower-limb paralysis to perform actions such as walking and arm movements. These devices adapt to the user’s movement patterns, offering customized support and aiding significantly in gait training. End-effector robots are particularly useful in gait rehabilitation, as they support specific limb segments, such as the hand or foot, allowing for isolated movement exercises. Notable examples include the Lokomat, which assists with gait training, and the ArmeoSpring, used for arm rehabilitation. Lastly, wearable
robotics----such as smart braces and gloves----are compact, sensor-driven devices that monitor movements and provide resistance for tasks like strengthening muscles and improving flexibility. Evidence suggests that different rehabilitation robot types, especially exoskeletons and end-effectors, play a crucial role in enhancing motor function and engagement in stroke and spinal cord injury recovery, making them valuable tools in personalized rehabilitation plans.14,16
