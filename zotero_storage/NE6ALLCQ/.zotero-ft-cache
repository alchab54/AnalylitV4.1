CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) 
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating web-based and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, electronic games (incl multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and other interactive and/or networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all subitems under item 5 - description of the intervention) may also be applicable for other study designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs, b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scienti c societies endorsing the checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT (nonpharmacologic treatment) items. Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clari cations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that you also RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *. In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - please include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS, or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on why the item was not relevant for this study.
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION IN JMIR AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED). Please ll in these questions diligently. Information will not be copyedited, so please use proper spelling and grammar, use correct capitalization, and avoid abbreviations.

1b-iii) Open vs. closed, web-based (self-assessment) vs. face-to-face assessments
in the METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. o ine), e.g., from an open access website or from a clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based trial, or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say if outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In traditional o ine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use “blinded” or “unblinded” to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials usually refers to “open access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what the main paper is reporting. If this information is missing from the main body of text, consider adding it)

"We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. About one in three participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average four out of eight chapters. Retention rates were 67% (n=250) at post-intervention and 56% (n=214) at six-month follow-up. At post-intervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention were maintained at follow-up, while in the waitlist group insomnia symptoms continued to improve during the follow-up period. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre- to postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good."

"However, reach and access to face-to-face, therapist-delivered CBT-I is limited [41-43], due to both structural and attitudinal barriers. Structural barriers include limited treatment availability, inadequate screening and referrals, and long waiting times [41]. Within-person attitudinal barriers include reservations about help-seeking in general or non pharmacological treatment options in particular [44, 45]. CBT-based self-help interventions may be a means to overcome these barriers and facilitate access to adequate treatment scalable and low-threshold [46]. Especially if they are provided online (Wickwire, 2019). Internet-based interventions have become increasingly popular in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders [e.g., 47], and offer easy accessibility, flexibility, and anonymity. They allow users to integrate an intervention into daily life and in many cases also to automatically monitor progress [48]. There is a growing body of evidence for internet-based CBI¬ I interventions [49, 50]. Meta analyses revealed large improvements in insomnia severity (g = 1.09) and other sleep outcomes (e.g., sleep efficiency and total sleep time) which are comparable to those found in face-to-to interventions [51, 52]. Also, quality of life, executive functions and work-related health and productivity have shown to be improved through internet-based CBT-I [53-56]. Findings indicate that internet-based CBT-I also prevents or reduces a symptoms of depression [57-60]. Fully automated internet-based self-help interventions without human guidance may have the greatest potential when it comes to scalability and cost-effectiveness. While some studies suggest that guided interventions are more effective than unguided ones [52, 61], unguided interventions may still yield large and sustainable effects compared with a waitlist or active control condition [62-67].

"So far, most research on online interventions has focused on web-based interventions [64]. In the past decade, mobile internet use has been growing and interventions that can be accessed on a smartphone promise a higher potential to reach users than those that require a large screen [68]. On the other hand, mobile use may be associated with different user requirements and expectations, including the length and duration of treatment modules or the presentation of information, which may affect adherence and treatment effects. While there already is a large number of consumer-targeting apps addressing and tracking sleep (behavior) available in mobile app stores, most of them lack evidence [69]. We only identified two RCTs evaluating app-based interventions for individuals with insomnia. One compared a fully automated Dutch intervention focusing on sleep restriction and relaxation to a waitlist condition [64]. The other compared a Persian self-help intervention based on a combination of Theory of Planned Behavior, Health Action Process Approach and CBT-I to an active control condition (patient education) [70]. While both interventions did not require any human input, the app by [64] included a conversation tool (chatbot) between the app and the participants as well as a number of persuasive strategies. Both RCTs applied strict inclusion criteria for study participation (i.e., insomnia symptoms in accordance with the criteria for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] diagnosis of insomnia) and found that the app-based intervention was superior to the control condition in the improvement of insomnia symptoms."

"Given the relative lack of evidence for mobile CBT-I interventions, the aim of the present study is to evaluate an unguided app-based training for individuals who wish to improve their sleep. The primary aim is to evaluate the effect of the intervention on sleep quality (insomnia symptoms). Secondary, exploratory aims include the intervention effects on insomnia-related impairment and depression symptoms as well as participant adherence to the intervention, working alliance and intervention acceptance."

"The intervention consists of eight consecutive chapters that can be completed in about ten minutes each and cover all CBT-I components recommended by the German Sleep Society (DGSM): Psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive restructuring and relaxation [30]. Table 1 summarizes the content of the individual chapters. The chapters are multimedia-based with short text passages, audio and video content, vignettes, as well as questions (multiple choice or free text) to foster an active engagement with the intervention content and also to tailor subsequent content based on the participants’ preference (e.g., whether they preferred information to be presented as text or video). The number of pages per chapter and the amount of plain text per page were kept to a minimum as factors like extensive text content and text-content complexity are likely to increase the risk of non-adherence [76]. The intervention is supplemented by a “30-second sleep diary” to be filled in every morning to monitor insomnia symptoms. For a duration of eight weeks, an automated reminder to fill in the sleep diary was sent every morning at 7:00 am. There were no reminders for progressing through the intervention. At the beginning, participants received a short automated feedback about their sleep based on the baseline RIS score. Participants reporting poor sleep were especially encouraged to use parts of the intervention that were marked as for “people with poor sleep” (e.g., sleep restriction)."

"Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). Sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) was assessed using the German Regensburg Insomnia Scale [72]. The scale covers psychophysiological (cognitive, emotional and behavioral) aspects of insomnia during the previous four weeks. The instrument consists of ten items to be answered on a 5-point self-rating scale ranging from 0 to 4. A total score of ≥13 indicates poor sleep [72]. The RIS has shown to be a well accepted, valid instrument that has discriminative power and is sensitive to detect improvements in insomnia parameters after CBT-I [72]. One additional item asked the participants about their perceived insomnia-related impairment in the past seven days on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Depressive symptoms and depression severity were measured using the German version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [77]. This widely used brief self-report instrument consists of nine items covering the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of depression which are scored on a four-point Likert scale from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-9 has been shown to have good psychometric properties [78] and also has demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in depressive symptomatology over time [79]. Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR). Acceptance of the intervention was assessed using the subscales “task” and “goal” of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised [80, 81], adapted for online interventions. The inventory is based on Bordin's alliance theory [82]. The “task” subscale (4 items) measures the agreement on the tasks of the intervention, whereas the „goal“ subscale (4 items) measures the agreement on the goals of the intervention. Due to the unguided nature of the study, the “bond” subscale (measuring the quality of an affective bond between patient [participant] and therapist [coach]) was removed. Items are answered on a scale from 1 (“seldom”) to 5 (“always”), but participants could also choose the additional answer category “I don’t know”. In addition to the WAI-SR, each chapter of the intervention could be rated on a five-point scale."

"All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 27. Statistical significance was set at α=.05. Differences in baseline socio-demographic and clinical scores between the intervention and the control group as well as between participants with poor vs. good sleep were analyzed using Pearson χ2-tests for dichotomous variables and independent-sample t-tests (two-sided) for metric variables. Differences between completers and non-completers were analyzed in the same way. Adherence and acceptance data were analyzed descriptively and compared between participants with a poor vs. a good sleep applying independent-sample t-tests. To identify potential predictors of adherence, Pearson’s correlations were calculated between adherence markers (number of chapters completed, number of sleep diary entries) and baseline variables. Primary (RIS) and secondary (perceived insomnia-related impairment, PHQ-9) outcomes were analyzed using linear repeated-measures mixed-effect models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) and an unstructured covariance matrix. This method follows the ITT approach and is recommended for RCTs with missing data [83]. Group, time and interaction of group and time were entered as fixed variables with group as a betweengroup variable and time as a within-group variable. The outcomes RIS, perceived insomniarelated impairment and PHQ-9 were entered as dependent variables in separate analyses. Within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated by dividing the estimated mean change from baseline to post-assessment (or follow-up) by the pooled standard deviation [84]. Between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were computed based on the difference of the estimated mean change from baseline to post-assessment (or follow-up) in the intervention group compared to the control group divided by the pooled standard deviation at baseline as recommended by [85]."

"The majority of participants in the full sample were women (63.7%), in a relationship (73.0%) and reported a higher level of education (87.3%; see Table 2). About one in four had children and about one in three were university students. The mean age of participants was 37.3 years (SD=12.24). Sleep was poor on average (indicated by the RIS score ≥ 13) and the average level of depression severity was mild."
16-i) Report multiple “denominators” and provide definitions
Report multiple “denominators” and provide de nitions: Report N’s (and effect sizes) “across a range of study participation [and use] thresholds” [1], e.g., N exposed, N consented, N used more than x times, N used more than y weeks, N participants “used” the intervention/comparator at speci c pre-de ned time points of interest (in absolute and relative numbers per group). Always clearly de ne “use” of the intervention.

"Results of the mixed model analyses are presented in Table 4. For the full sample, a significant group × time interaction was found for the RIS at post assessment (F1, 269.31=11.93; P=.001) with a small between-group effect (d=.26). Participants in the intervention group showed a stronger reduction (mean difference = –2.66; dwithin=.45) in the RIS scores than participants in the control group (mean difference = –1.04; dwithin=.17). At follow up, the group × time interaction failed to reach significance (F1, 227.63=3.54; P=.06). Within-group improvements in the perceived insomnia-related impairment due to sleep problems as well as in the PHQ-9 did not differ significantly between the study arms."
17a-i) Presentation of process outcomes such as metrics of use and intensity of
use
In addition to primary/secondary (clinical) outcomes, the presentation of process outcomes such as metrics of use and intensity of use (dose, exposure) and their operational de nitions is critical. This does not only refer to metrics of attrition (13-b) (often a binary variable), but also to more continuous exposure metrics such as “average session length”. These must be accompanied by a technical description how a metric like a “session” is de ned (e.g., timeout after idle time) [1] (report under item 6a).

"Complete WAI-SR that allows calculating scores data is available for N=87 participants from the intervention group. The participants agreed between “sometimes” and “fairly often” with the tasks of the intervention and between “fairly often” and “often” with the goals of the intervention. Acceptance did not differ between participants with poor and good sleep at baseline (see Table 3). Participants who answered the session rating of the intervention chapters rated chapters 16 as “good” on average, whereas chapter 7-8 were rated as “moderate”. There was no significant difference in session ratings between participants with poor vs. good sleep, except for session 2 that was rated better and nearly “excellent” by participants with good sleep."

"In the subgroup analyses including only participants with poor sleep at baseline, a significant group × time interaction was found for the RIS at post assessment (F1, 180.66=12.59; P=<.001; d=.47) and for the perceived insomnia-related impairment at post assessment (F1, 184.45=6.69; P=.01; d=.45) as well as for the RIS at follow up assessment (F1, 147.56=4.60; P=.03; d=.33). Although the intervention group showed somewhat larger reductions in the PHQ-9 than the control group, the difference was not significant." "To assess clinically relevant improvements, we assessed how many participants with poor sleep at baseline had reduced their RIS score below 13 points at post-intervention and follow-up. At post-intervention, this was true for N=25 out of 69 (36.2%) assessment completers in the intervention group and N=16 out of 102 (15.7%) assessment completers in the control group. This difference is statistically significant (χ2=9.531; P=.002). At follow up, there was no significant difference between the groups (21 out of 53 IG completers vs. 25 out of 90 CG completers; χ2=2.145; P=.143). In the ITT analysis of clinically relevant improvements, the odds of suffering from poor sleep at post-intervention was also significantly larger in the control group than in the intervention group (OR=0.462 [0.218 -0.976])."
18-i) Subgroup analysis of comparing only users
A subgroup analysis of comparing only users is not uncommon in ehealth trials, but if done, it must be stressed that this is a self-selected sample and no longer an unbiased sample from a randomized trial (see 16-iii).

We did not include qualitative feedback, but asked the participants to complete a short session rating at the end of each intervention chapter. "Participants who answered the session rating of the intervention chapters rated chapters 16 as “good” on average, whereas chapter 7-8 were rated as “moderate”. There was no significant difference in session ratings between participants with poor vs. good sleep, except for session 2 that was rated better and nearly “excellent” by participants with good sleep."

"The aim of the present study was to evaluate an unguided app-based training to improve sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) in individuals who wish to improve their sleep compared to a waitlist control group. Specifically, we examined participant adherence to the intervention, working alliance and intervention acceptance, and intervention effects on sleep quality (insomnia symptoms), insomnia-related impairment and depression symptoms."
"In our study, the unguided app-based intervention was associated with a short-term improvement of insomnia symptoms that remained stable over a period of six months. Participants in the waitlist condition also reported an improvement in their insomnia symptoms, but this improvement took longer. Effects were more pronounced in individuals with low sleep at baseline. We detected no effect on depression symptoms in our sample, which may largely be due to low average symptom load at baseline."
"Non-usage attrition was comparable to other digital interventions [86], with a larger loss of participants during the early intervention phase and about one in three participants completing the intervention. About one in three participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention."
"Participants in the intervention group were able to form a moderate working alliance with the unguided intervention, with a slightly larger concordance regarding goals than regarding tasks."
"The first six chapters of the intervention were on average rated “good”, while the final two chapters were rated “moderate”."

"It is noteworthy however that one in four women and one in two men who were assigned to the intervention group did not start the intervention. In clinical practice, the motivation and ability to adhere to a self-guided intervention should thus be carefully assessed. In participants who did start the intervention, adherence was comparable to other digital interventions. In future adaptations of the interventions, adherence may be improved by involving a multidisciplinary team of psychologists, user experience specialists and UX designers in the design of the user interface, which unfortunately was not possible in our study due to budget constraints."
20-i) Typical limitations in ehealth trials
Typical limitations in ehealth trials: Participants in ehealth trials are rarely blinded. Ehealth trials often look at a multiplicity of outcomes, increasing risk for a Type I error. Discuss biases due to non-use of the intervention/usability issues, biases through informed consent procedures, unexpected events.

"Limitations of our study include the lack of more specific measures for insomnia-related impairment and socioeconomic consequences including absenteeism or loss of productivity as well as an objective measure of sleep quality. However, subjective measures of sleep quality and insomnia symptoms are widely used in research on CBT-I and the added value of objective measures is a matter of debate [93]. The participants in this trial might have also suffered from sleep disorders other than insomnia , in which an intervention covering the principles of CBT-I is likely to have limited or no effect. Future studies may benefit from including insomnia diagnosis confirmed by a clinician. Adherence to the intervention was approximated by examining usage data. We did not collect information on whether and how participants in the intervention group implemented the suggested behavior changes. Also, the study design is not suitable to determine to what extent the interventions components contributed to the effects."
