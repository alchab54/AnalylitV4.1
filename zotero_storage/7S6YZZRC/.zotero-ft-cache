Abstract

Concern about the leakage of methadone and other substitute drugs into the illicit market has recently prompted a tightening of the procedures surrounding prescribing and dispensing practices. Nowadays, drug users are frequently obliged to comply with a number of conditions in order to receive their medication. The aim of the present paper is to examine these conditions from the perspective of drug users. The research was funded by the Scottish Office and involved semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 124 illicit drug users. All interviews were audio-recorded with full transcription and analysis of the transcribed material was carried out using the software package, Winmax. The findings reveal that the various conditions attached to substitute prescribing are neither uniformly enforced by prescribers and dispensers nor uniformly experienced by users. Sometimes restrictions are experienced as a pointless exercise and an infringement of civil liberties; sometimes they are accepted as a necessary evil; and sometimes they are welcomed as a useful aid in controlling and overcoming addiction. It is concluded that drug users do not generally consider substitute drugs to be just like any other medication. Furthermore, their opinions and experiences may have much to teach policy makers and providers about how to use conditions to their optimal advantage.
