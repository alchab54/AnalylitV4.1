Abstract
Genetic counselors routinely provide service in many environments, including
counseling-type and medical-type rooms; in this study, counseling environments
are characterized by office décor that facilitates discussion around a seated table,
while medical environments include an exam table and separate seating. Outside
of the genetic counseling context, manipulation of the environment can influence
client comfort in disclosing personal information, well-being, and overall satisfaction
with clinician communication. However, there is little known about how clients
experience genetic counseling in one environment versus the other and how that
might influence their evaluation of genetic counselor communication. To explore the
extent to which the physical environment influences client perceptions, we video
recorded two simulated sessions addressing the same genetic counseling topic with
two contrasting styles of communication (more and less patient-centered) in front of
a greenscreen background. Videos were digitally placed in counseling and medical
environments such that the same verbal and nonverbal communication was presented
in the two environments, creating a total of four videos (e.g., a 2 × 2 experimental
design). Participants (N = 861) were randomly assigned to observe one of the four
videos and respond as if they were the client in the video (e.g., as analog clients).
Overall, participants rated the less patient-centered communication more favorably
(p < 0.05 across variables), contrary to our expectations. Structural equation modeling
revealed that perceptions of nonverbal communication mediated the relationship
between communication style and perceptions of the counselor's encouragement
of participation in the session and the therapeutic bond. Results offer insight into
how the physical environment might influence communication in genetic counseling,
illustrating new avenues for improving client-counselor communication in this context.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Establishing a therapeutic relationship is a key component to
successful genetic counseling and can have tangible effects
on clients' health and well-being. In psychotherapy, a strong
therapeutic relationship is associated with better client outcomes,
including better quality of life, satisfaction with care, and decreased
symptoms of depression (Barber et al., 2000; Howgego et al., 2003).
Moreover, a poor client-counselor relationship can actively worsen
psychological symptoms (Goldsmith et al., 2015). Genetic counseling
is often a short-term relationship, though this therapeutic bond has
been demonstrated within single sessions (Caleshu et al., 2022; Erby
et al., 2021; Murray et al., 2022). However, the circumstances that
optimally support forming this bond have been under-researched in
genetic counseling. This study aims to explore whether the physical
environment in which genetic counseling takes place and the
patient-centeredness of counselor communication affect the degree
to which a therapeutic bond is formed in pre-test genetic counseling
for hereditary cancer risk.
1.1 | Patient-centered communication and the therapeutic bond in genetic counseling
Patient-centered communication can be broadly conceptualized
as communication that actively seeks to understand client
perspectives, encourages participation, recognizes the client
within a larger psychosocial context, and facilitates shared
understanding and decision-making aligned with the clients'
values (Epstein et al., 2005). Patient-centered communication
includes verbal communication features, such as displaying
understanding and empathy, as well as nonverbal communication,
such as effective eye contact (Gorawara-Bhat & Cook, 2011).
Patient-centeredness has been quantitatively operationalized
using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) in a variety of
medical studies as well as specifically applied to genetic counseling
communication (Roter et al., 2006; Roter & Larson, 2002). Patient
centered communication is associated with better relationship
building, patient satisfaction, psychological adjustment, and
patient participation in care (Mead & Bower, 2000; Pinto
et al., 2012; Wissow et al., 2010). In genetic counseling, patient
centered communication has been seen to contribute to better
ratings of genetic counselor affect, more satisfaction with the
communication, and better ratings of nonverbal communication
by simulated clients (Roter et al., 2006).
1.2 | The physical environment and communication
Although evidence supports the importance of patient-centered
communication in genetic counseling and for establishing a
therapeutic relationship in medical encounters, little is known
about factors that might affect the patient-centeredness of
genetic counseling communication. Research in the medical
and counseling psychology fields has documented the ways in
which variation of elements within the physical environment
can influence perceptions of patient-centeredness (Ajiboye
et al., 2015; Almquist et al., 2009; Okken et al., 2012). For
example, in a randomized experiment investigating the physical
environment in medical consultation rooms, clients who sat with
a clinician at a table, rather than on an exam bed, were more
satisfied with how clinicians engaged them about their health
records (Ajiboye et al., 2015). Additionally, a simulated counseling
study found that individuals who participated in counseling in an
environment that included personal items (e.g., rugs and photos)
rated the environment as more intimate, felt more relaxed, and self
disclosed at a more intimate level than those who participated in
the same environment without the personal items present (Chaikin
et al., 1976). These examples demonstrate that manipulation of
specific elements within the physical environment can influence
both perceptions of communication as well as client participation
in care. However, genetic counselors routinely provide service
in both counseling-type and medical-type environments, and
research is needed to understand how this element of the physical
environment might influence perceptions of communication or
relationship building in genetic counseling.
In genetic counseling, a counseling-type environment is often
characterized by office décor that facilitates discussion around
a seated table, while medical-type environments, typical to out
patient clinics, usually include an exam table and separate seat
ing. Few studies have examined how the physical environment
influences client-counselor communication across environments,
rather than within environments. A retrospective study of client
empowerment and self-efficacy after genetic counseling found
that clients who were seen in a counseling room tended to re
port more favorable ratings than those who were seen in medi
cal exam rooms, though the effect was null (Morris et al., 2019).
What is known about this topic?
Previous work has demonstrated the importance of
patient-centered communication in medical appointments,
including genetic counseling sessions. The physical
environment in which communication takes place has also
been associated with client comfort in disclosing personal
information, client well-being, and overall satisfaction with
counselor communication.
What this paper adds to the topic?
The study provides evidence that client perceptions of
the counseling environment can influence how favorably
they view the genetic counselor's verbal and nonverbal
communication and relationship-building.

Null effects in this study may be due, in part, to the limitations
of the retrospective design and a discrepancy in the distribution
of clients who completed the survey data in each environment.
Additionally, a qualitative study of women at risk for breast cancer
found that changing the session context of the genetics clinic from
a medical environment in a hospital to a house located across the
street improved client comfort and alleviated feelings of being pre
symptomatically pathologized (Phelps et al., 2008). Although these
studies provide evidence that perhaps a counseling-type environ
ment is preferable to clients who are receiving genetic counseling,
further systematic research on the effects of the environment on
client experiences is needed.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Hypotheses and research question
Based on the existing understanding of verbal and nonverbal
patient-centered communication, their relationship to each other
and to relationship-building, we propose the following hypotheses
(see Figure 1 for the full hypothesized model):
Hypothesis 1. More patient-centered verbal genetic
counselor communication will be associated with
better ratings of features of the counselor's (a) non
verbal and (b) verbal communication (encouraging
participation).
Hypothesis 2. Better ratings of verbal patient
centeredness features (encouraging participation) will
be associated with better ratings of the therapeutic
relationship.
Hypothesis 3. Better ratings of nonverbal patient
centeredness will be associated with better ratings
of (a) features of verbal genetic counseling com
munication (encouraging participation) and (b) the
therapeutic relationship.
Given the dearth of literature in this area, the following research
question was proposed to investigate the effect of the physical envi
ronment on analog client perceptions of genetic counseling commu
nication and relationship building:
RQ: Does the physical environment in which genetic
counseling occurs moderate the relationship be
tween genetic counselor communication and analog
client perceptions of features of verbal and nonverbal
patient-centeredness and the therapeutic bond?
2.2 | Participants and procedures
Participants were recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk
crowdsourcing platform and CloudResearch participant manage
ment system in August of 2020. CloudResearch was used to in
crease the integrity of our data. Only users previously vetted by
CloudResearch as having high-quality responses were invited to take
part. Additionally, Qualtrics security metrics were turned on (e.g.,
time tracking and preventing multiple submissions) and participants
were asked to attest before and after the survey that they would re
spond to the best of their ability. Recruitment was based on a power
analysis that estimated 787 participants would be needed to detect
a small effect size (f = 0.10) with two groups (two rooms) at 80%
power and an alpha level of 0.05. We aimed to collect a final sample
of 800 participants for the study. Accounting for potential attrition
and/or insufficient quality of responses of 10% of participants, we
aimed to enroll 900 participants (N = 902).
Participants were randomly assigned to view one of four vid
eos created for the study. Randomization was completed using
Qualtrics block randomization with a quota of 225 for each exper
imental condition. Each video depicted a 10-min simulated pre
test genetic counseling session for hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer. Details about each session type are expanded on below.
After viewing, participants responded to a cross-sectional survey
from the perspective of the client (i.e., responded as an analog
client). Eligible participants were 18 years or older, identified as
female or non-binary, able to read English, had Internet access to

connect to the survey, and were able to provide informed consent.
Participation was limited to female and non-binary participants to
enhance identification with the client actor, which is shown to in
crease the similarity of ratings between analog and actual clients
(Blanch-Hartigan et al., 2013; van Vliet et al., 2012). Participants
who successfully completed the survey were compensated $5.00.
This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health's institutional review board.
2.3 | Experimental manipulation
We employed a two-by-two study design. Independent variables
included manipulation of the physical environment (counseling
room and medical exam room) and communication styles (more
and less patient-centered). Four video recordings were prepared
as experimental stimuli. Two videos presented the genetic coun
selor in front of a greenscreen background, which was substituted
with an image of a counseling office or an image of a medical exam
room. In each, a genetic counseling client was being addressed
off-screen (Figure 2). This design allowed for the same verbal and
nonverbal communication in the clinical teaching arm of the study
to be presented in the counseling and medical environments, as
well as the communication in the psychosocial counseling in the
counseling and medical environments. Scripts for both sessions
were based on previously collected video recordings of genetic
counselors in simulated pre-test cancer genetic counseling ses
sions that had been coded using the Roter Interaction Analysis
System (RIAS) (Roter et al., 2006). The two models of genetic
counseling were chosen for adaptation in this study because of
their markedly different patterns of patient-centeredness; RIAS
coding of clinical teaching sessions were characterized as sig
nificantly less patient-centered than psychosocial counseling
sessions. Content was arranged in approximately the same order
and informational elements of each session were kept consist
ent. Consistent with the earlier simulation study, clinical teaching
communication was designed to be less patient-centered, charac
terized by low amounts of relationship building (3.2% of session)
and high amounts of client education (64.0% of session) as coded
using RIAS. Additionally, the clinical teaching communication in
cluded high verbal dominance of the genetic counselor (11:1 ratio
of counselor to client word count). The psychosocial counseling
communication style was designed to be more patient-centered,
characterized by high amounts of relationship building (42.0% of
session) and lower levels of education (27.0% of session) as coded
using RIAS. The psychosocial counseling communication included
low verbal dominance of the counselor (2.5:1 ratio of counselor
to client word count). The scenario was read by multiple board
certified genetic counselors to check for face validity. The genetic
counselor and client actors made efforts to maintain similar non
verbal communication in each scenario (e.g., keeping the same
affect, rate of speech, and facial expressions). However, because
the verbal communication was different across the two videos, it
was not possible to have the exact same nonverbal communication
across the two communication types. The final videos were also
viewed by genetic counseling students and practicing counselors
to ensure that the shortened sessions were representative of ac
tual clinical encounters.
2.4 | Measures
The outcome of interest was analog client perceptions of the
therapeutic bond. The predictor variable was scripted counse
lor communication style. Mediating variables included ratings of
nonverbal communication and ratings of features of verbal com
munication (encouraging participation). Room type was treated
as a moderating independent variable. For each unobserved vari
able (perceptions of the bond, ratings of nonverbal communica
tion, and ratings of encouraging participation), a series of initial
analyses were conducted to assess scale reliability and dimension
ality. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed for each
unobserved variable using combined data from all experimental
groups. All CFA assumed a single latent variable in alignment with
the expected unidimensional structures. Overall CFA fit was as
sessed using a combination of metrics including confirmatory fit

index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA),
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and χ2. The cut-offs
for good fit were CFI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.06, SRMR < 0.08, and an
insignificant χ2 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Adequate fit was considered
at CFI > 0.90, RMSEA < 0.08, SRMR < 0.10, and χ2/df <3 (Herzog &
Boomsma, 2009).
2.4.1 | The therapeutic bond
Perception of the therapeutic bond was assessed using the bond
subscale of the observer version of the Working Alliance Inventory
(Darchuck et al., 2000). The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-O)
bond scale is a 12-item measure on a 7-point Likert scale (never to
always). Two modifications were made to the WAI-O to reflect the
counseling setting: (1) the word therapist was changed to genetic
counselor and (2) the phrase therapy session was changed to genetic
counseling session. We used only the nine positively-worded items
for analysis as described previously (Broadbridge et al., 2024).
Items were averaged for a final score that could range from 1 to
7. Higher scores indicate perception of a better bond. An example
item from this measure includes, “the client feels that the genetic
counselor appreciates her as a person.” The unidimensional factor
structure (CFA) supported good model fit (χ2(35) = 119.78, p < 0.01;
RMSEA = 0.05 (CI 0.04, 0.06); CFI = 0.99; SRMR = 0.02).
2.4.2 | Genetic counselors' nonverbal communication
Perception of nonverbal communication was assessed using a 6
item questionnaire adapted from Roter et al. (2006). Participants
rated nonverbal behaviors associated with patient-centered com
munication, such as facial expressions, eye contact, and head nods
(D'agostino & Bylund, 2011; Gorawara-Bhat & Cook, 2011). Based
on factor loadings, model fit, and theoretical relatedness, one item
(related to the counselor's use of silence) was not retained result
ing in a final composite with five items. Modification indices sup
ported two covariations between error terms, one between the
use of eye contact and head nods, and the other between the use
of head nods and facial expressions to facilitate communication.
The final factor structure supported good model fit ( χ2(3) = 11.73,
p = 0.01; RMSEA = 0.06 (CI 0.03, 0.09); CFI = 1.00; SRMR = 0.01).
Items were averaged for a final score that could range from 1 to
6. Higher scores indicate more favorable ratings of nonverbal
communication.
2.4.3 | Encouragement of client participation
An important feature of patient-centered communication is en
couraging client engagement in the decision-making process and
in participating in care, conceptualized in this study as encouraging
participation. Perceptions of encouraging participation were cap
tured using two items adapted from Roter et al. (2006). Items were
on 6-point semantic differential scales where lower scores were
more favorable ratings of the counselor. The first item ranged from,
“Encourages client involvement in decision-making” to “Discourages
client involvement in decision-making”. The second item ranged from,
“Encourages client questions” to “Discourages client questions”.
Items were totaled for a score that could range from 2 to 12.
2.5 | Analyses
Preliminary analyses included pairwise correlations with Bonferroni
adjusted significance levels across model variables (see Table 2). The
relationships between counseling style and room type with the
communication and relationship variables were explored using one
way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Structural equation modeling
(SEM) using maximum likelihood estimation was conducted to assess
the overall fit of the proposed model. Two models were tested, one for
each room type. Model fit was assessed for SEM as described above
for CFA; the cut-offs for good fit were CFI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.06,
SRMR < 0.08, and an insignificant χ2 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Adequate
fit was considered at CFI > 0.90, RMSEA < 0.08, SRMR < 0.10, and
χ2/df < 3 (Herzog & Boomsma, 2009). Data were analyzed using
STATA (version 17.0).
3 | RESULTS
In total, 902 responses were collected. Participants were excluded
from analyses if they self-selected an option indicating that their data
was not quality (n = 2), if there was an issue with validity on a free
text response (n = 9), or if they took less than 15 min to complete the
study (n = 29; videos required 10 min to view). One participant who
reported their age as greater than 800 years was excluded from the
analyses. In total, 861 responses were included in subsequent analy
ses. There were no significant differences in demographics across
experimental conditions (see Table 1). Participants who viewed the
clinical teaching experimental condition consistently reported bet
ter ratings of the therapeutic bond, nonverbal communication, and
encouraging participation than those who viewed the psychosocial
counseling experimental condition, contrary to the hypothesized di
rectionality (see Table 2). Participants who viewed the medical room
experimental condition consistently reported better ratings than
those who viewed the counseling room (see Table 2).
3.1 | Structural equation models of
communication and perceptions of the relationship
Structural models were assembled using the measurement struc
tures established through CFA. The counseling room model (CR
Model) included only participants who viewed the counseling office.

The medical room (MR Model) included only participants who
viewed the medical exam room.
3.1.1 | CR model: Counseling room
The model of therapeutic bond in the counseling office was well
supported by the data (χ2(113)= 218.31, p< 0.01; RMSEA =0.05
(CI= 0.04, 0.06); CFI =0.98; SRMR =0.03). The model accounted for
43.6% of the variance in ratings of the therapeutic bond, 96.7% of
the variance in nonverbal communication ratings, and 51.4% of the
variance in perceptions of the counselor encouraging participation.
The path from communication style to encouraging participation was
not significant (H1b not supported). The path from communication
style to nonverbal communication was significant, though in the oppo
site direction as originally hypothesized (H1a not supported). All other
paths were supported in the hypothesized directions. Better ratings of
encouraging participation in care were associated with better ratings
of the therapeutic bond (H2 supported). Better ratings of the nonver
bal communication were also associated with ratings of more encour
agement of client participation and better ratings of the therapeutic
bond (H3a and H3b supported). See Figure 3 for the final model.

3.1.2 | MR model: Medical room
Similarly, the model of therapeutic bond in the medical room
was also well-supported by the data (χ2(113) = 224.19, p < 0.01;
RMSEA = 0.05 (CI = 0.04, 0.06); CFI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.04). The
model accounted for 41.3% of the variance in ratings of the thera
peutic bond, 99.3% of the variance in nonverbal communication
ratings, and 49.2% of the variance in perceptions of the counselor
encouraging participation. By contrast to the counseling office,
the path from communication style to nonverbal communication
was not significant (H1a not supported). The path from commu
nication style to encouraging participation was significant, but in
the opposite direction as hypothesized (H1b not supported). All
other paths were in the hypothesized directions. Better ratings
of encouraging participation in care were associated with better
ratings of the therapeutic bond (H2 supported). Better ratings of
the nonverbal communication were also associated with ratings of
more encouragement of client participation and better ratings of
the therapeutic bond (H3a and H3b supported). See Figure 3 for
the final model.
3.1.3 | Model moderation
To test RQ1, invariance across the CR and MR models was compared
using a change in χ2 analysis, comparing a structurally constrained
model to a fully unconstrained model. The models were signifi
cantly different (Δχ2 = 166.87, Δdf = 118, p < 0.01), indicating that
the constrained model fit the data better than the unconstrained
model. In other words, these results supported a moderation effect
of room type on the relationships between variables in the model.
Unconstrained Wald tests of invariance between the models re
vealed one significantly different structural path across CR and MR
models. The path from communication style to encouraging partici
pation in care significantly varied across models, with the path being
stronger for the medical room (MR model) than for the counseling
room (CR model) (p = 0.02). Though not statistically significant by in
variance testing, other differences across the models were present.
For both models, participants who viewed the clinical teaching style
had more positive views of the counselor's nonverbal communica
tion, though this relationship was only significant for the CR model.
The clinical teaching style was also positively associated with per
ceptions of more encouragement of participation, though this rela
tionship was only significant for the MR model.
Similarities across the models were also seen. Nonverbal com
munication was strongly positively associated with better ratings of
the therapeutic bond for both the CR and MR models (B = 0.40 and
0.35). Nonverbal communication was also strongly positively asso
ciated with perceptions of more encouragement of participation in
the CR and MR models (B = 0.69 and 0.67). As hypothesized, higher
ratings of encouraging participation were positively associated with
better ratings of the therapeutic bond in both the CR and MR mod
els (B = 0.41 and 0.43). In other words, in both models (e.g., both

environments), there was an indirect effect of communication style
on the therapeutic bond that was mediated by perceptions of the
genetic counselor's nonverbal communication (CR model) or percep
tions of the genetic counselor's encouraging of participation in the
appointment (MR model).
4 | DISCUSSION
This study explored the influence of the physical environment and
communication style on analog clients' perceptions of communica
tion and the therapeutic bond within simulated genetic counseling
sessions. Overall, there was no direct effect of the experimentally
manipulated room type on ratings of the therapeutic bond, ratings
of nonverbal communication, or ratings of encouraging participa
tion. By contrast, there was an effect related to counseling style;
the clinical teaching was rated more favorably than the psychosocial
counseling. This was contrary to our expectations. Although there
were no direct effects of the physical environment observed, indi
rect effects of the environment on the therapeutic relationship were
seen via SEM.
One potential reason for the unexpected findings may be
attributed to participant expectations. Most participants had
no experience with genetic counseling outside of the study (see
Table 1). The communication manipulation may have confounded
the naïve observer as to what in fact the objective of a genetic
counseling session is. Where the clinical teaching approach could
readily be seen as direct and relevant to someone seeking clin
ical expertise, the counseling approach used less direct com
munication and may have been perceived as uncertain or less
relevant. In this way, observers may have been more critical of
the genetic counselor using psychosocial counseling communica
tion (cf., Blanch et al., 2009). It is also possible that the exper
imental manipulation of communication had unintended effects.
In the clinical teaching video, the client actor had very few lines,
and therefore gave very few verbal indications about the extent
to which her needs were being met. By contrast, in the psycho
social counseling video, the genetic counselor spent more time
eliciting the client's narrative, asking open-ended questions, and
attending to the client's emotion statements. In this way, partic
ipants who viewed the psychosocial counseling model may have
had stronger reactions to the discussion and subsequently had
higher expectations of what could have been accomplished in a
genetic counseling session. Conversely, because there were very
few emotional cues in the clinical teaching, participants may have
had lower expectations for the relationship and have based the
ratings more on the quality and pace of the information given.
Although we chose to use markedly different styles of commu
nication in this study, it is possible that this manipulation elicited
different expectations of what a genetic counseling appointment
could or should be. Similarly, it is possible that expectations set
by the environments, coupled with the study design of viewing a
single environment (rather than a cross-over design) produced the
unanticipated findings. For example, participants may not expect
a high degree of shared decision-making in a medical office. Thus,
regardless of the type of communication they saw, their low ex
pectations for shared decision-making could have been exceeded,
resulting in higher ratings of patient- centeredness.
4.1 | Theoretical contributions: Patient-centered communication in genetic counseling
SEM revealed that, even when the counselor's communication
was designed to be more patient-centered, participants' rat
ings of the counselor's nonverbal behaviors mediated how they
perceived verbal communication and ratings of the therapeutic
bond between client and genetic counselor. This relationship was

consistent for both communication styles and across room types.
In other words, regardless of the actual verbal communication or
the physical environment viewed, when participants thought the
nonverbal communication was effective, they perceived a stronger
therapeutic bond. This finding emphasizes the importance of non
verbal communication in establishing an effective relationship in
genetic counseling.
Patient-centeredness of communication predicted percep
tions of nonverbal communication such that less patient-centered
communication was associated with more positive ratings of the
nonverbal communication when participants viewed the coun
seling office, though not the medical room. Conversely, patient
centeredness of communication predicted perceptions of verbal
communication when participants viewed the medical, though not
for the counseling office. This finding suggests that there may be
a difference in how verbal and nonverbal communication behav
iors are perceived within different clinical environments. Future
research should consider collecting perceptions of both verbal
and nonverbal communication behaviors when studying the in
fluence of patient-centered communication on genetic counseling
outcomes.
Results of this study align with prior research showing that more
patient-centered nonverbal communication, such as eye contact and
head nodding, are associated with better ratings of health care pro
fessionals (Griffith et al., 2003). However, the results diverge from
current understanding of patient-centered verbal communication
behaviors and their expected positive relationship with perceptions
of nonverbal communication behaviors and participation in care
(e.g., Pinto et al., 2012; Thom, 2001). Participants who viewed the
patient-centered verbal communication rated the nonverbal com
munication worse overall, though the association was only signifi
cant in our model when participants viewed the counseling office
and not the medical exam room. Although we attempted to have
consistent nonverbal communication in the simulated sessions, it is
possible that there were subtle differences across the two commu
nication types that may have been amplified based on perceptions
of the presented verbal communication. The unexpected findings
support the need for additional considerations when employing ex
perimentally manipulated communication, such as measurements of
expectations of the environment before watching the interaction
and warrant future research.
4.2 | Strengths and limitations
Although this study has provided preliminary evidence to suggest
that perceptions of the physical environment are related to how
participants perceived the genetic counseling communication and
the therapeutic bond, there are limitations to these findings. First,
the study was conducted using virtual simulated counseling ses
sions and analog clients. Because of this, participants were not
able to respond in real-time to the counselor and thus our study
captured only participant's perceptions of the session, rather than
the process of communication and relationship-building them
selves. Future research should include methods that allow par
ticipants to interact with and respond to the simulated genetic
counselor. Second, this study used only one genetic counselor, one
client actor, and one clinical scenario. Previous analog studies in
genetic counseling have found that participants were able to re
late well to a simulated session (Portnoy et al., 2010), though it
is possible that participants did not connect with this particular
client. A third limitation is the demographic make-up of our study.
Because our scenario was for breast cancer risk assessment and
we wanted to ensure similarity to the analog patient, we chose
to only recruit female participants. While there is no data to sug
gest that men would have different perceptions of these environ
ments, this has not yet been investigated. Likewise, our sample
was not diverse enough to investigate differences across racial
and ethnic demographics. The composition of this sample being
mostly non-Hispanic White limits the generalizability to individu
als from varying cultural backgrounds. Knowing that concord
ance between patients and clinicians across social demographics
(e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, and age) can affect satisfaction with
care overall (Thornton et al., 2011), it is possible that results of
the mostly white sample would differ in a more diverse, and thus
more racially discordant sample. Future research should examine
whether the relationships among variables in this study replicate
in more diverse populations, and in contexts that affect all gen
ders. In addition to these limitations, the present study had sev
eral important strengths. First, the use of video simulation and
an analog client allowed for a well-controlled randomized study.
Participants viewed the exact same interaction in the two envi
ronments, with the same verbal and nonverbal communication
and relationship-building characteristics. This design helped to
better disentangle the effects of the physical environment from
the effects of patient-counselor communication within a live ses
sion. Additionally, the large sample size allowed for the detection
of subtle effects on perceptions of the genetic counseling session
and the use of structural equation modeling to investigate the re
lationships between the variables of interest. Although we asked
participants to imagine they were in the room with the counselor in
the video, the greenscreen format of the videos shared character
istics with video telehealth visits. As genetic counseling is increas
ingly being offered via telemedicine (National Society of Genetic
Counselors, 2022, 2023), our study provides additional insight into
how clients may perceive the genetic counseling interaction when
the counselor is in different environments. Future research focus
ing specifically on the environment in genetic counseling delivered
by telemedicine is needed to understand whether these results di
rectly translate to that context.
4.3 | Practice implications
One implication for practicing genetic counselors is to explicitly ad
dress the physical environment. For counselors who practice in both

counseling and medical environments, it may be worth asking clients
which room they would prefer. When there is no option for the type
of environment, it may be important to help orient the session to the
room. For example, genetic counselors practicing in medical-type
environments may want to address that the client will not need to
have a physical exam during the session and that the primary goal
is to have a conversation about the client's experiences and values.
While each genetic counseling client is unique, alleviating potential
anxiety caused by being in a medical exam room may be one way to
increase a client's perceptions of the room as comfortable and create
a different expectation than the type of appointment that is typical
in medical exam rooms. Likewise, it underscores the importance of
agenda-setting in appointments that take place in counseling rooms,
setting the expectation that both medical and counseling topics may
be addressed.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
Overall, this research suggests that the physical environment can
influence how clients experience genetic counseling sessions.
Results provide evidence that the physical environment and the way
it makes clients feel may affect client perceptions of communication
and the therapeutic bond in genetic counseling sessions. These
findings are important for practicing genetic counselors as they
consider how best to facilitate an environment that is perceived as
comfortable, no matter where they are located, and supports the
need for future studies to explore how the physical environment
influences the genetic counseling session and the genetic counseling
process.
