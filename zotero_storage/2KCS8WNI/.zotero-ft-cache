AI’s Healthcare Revolution Needs a Human Touch in 2025

Artificial intelligence (AI) will drive a paradigm shift in patient treatment in 2025, moving us toward real-time, hyper-personalized care plans powered by advanced diagnostics, predictive analytics, and even AI-assisted robotic surgery. 

However, it’s behind the scenes in the back-office where AI will have the most day-to-day impact for healthcare organizations across the country. As the industry grapples with challenges like clinician burnout, regulatory scrutiny, soaring costs and sustainability, AI stands out as a powerful tool to solve these everyday problems in the year ahead. 

Here are some of my thoughts on how AI will influence the healthcare in 2025. 

Process AI is in the Spotlight 

For the AI revolution to truly succeed in improving patient outcomes, the ability to discover, monitor, predict and simulate healthcare processes will need to take center stage in 2025. This sort of technology – called process intelligence – will help keep human oversight front and center in patient care, achieve compliance with complex regulations, and maintain ethical guardrails. 

Without a robust process intelligence backbone to navigate patient workflow nuances, healthcare organizations risk losing the trust and empathy that only human involvement can provide. 

By using AI to discover how processes, employees and technology intersect, healthcare administrators can address pain points to increase efficiency, reduce costs and provide a better experience for staff and patients. Having a digital twin of your entire operations enables you to see the best path for improvement, improving confidence and efficacy in decision-making. In addition, process simulation tools can predict the impact of proposed or hypothetical changes to resources and procedures to further boost confidence and reduce the risk of failed deployments. For example, healthcare leaders may wish to assess ‘what if’ scenarios, such as what would happen if more staff were employed in billing departments, or if outstanding invoices can be resolved quicker with investment in intelligent automation? 

Even minor changes in operations can translate into significant time reduction and cost savings, or they might simply move a bottleneck to a point in the process more visible to the customer. Process simulation prevents undesirable outcomes, and keeps technology working for healthcare providers, patients and staff, rather than just the bottom line. 

Environmentally Friendly AI Development 

Hospitals produce an average of 50 petabytes – that’s 50 million gigabytes – of data per year, made of information from clinical notes, lab tests, medical images, sensor readings, and operational and financial data – with as much as 97 percent going unused. 

This vast data footprint significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. As climate change remains a pressing issue, healthcare organizations are seeking sustainable solutions. While AI itself is known to be highly consumptive of energy, it also offers a way forward. 

By processing massive datasets efficiently, AI can identify opportunities to optimize energy use, reducing the environmental impact of data storage and transmission. This approach not only 

supports sustainability goals but also enhances energy efficiency across the sector. For example, most organizations (57 percent) believe digital twin technology is critical to improving sustainability efforts. The technology can reduce the carbon footprint of an office building alone by up to 50 percent. 

New Laws and Regulations 

Regulatory scrutiny will continue to intensify in 2025 to enforce the safe and ethical use of AI in healthcare. This could encompass rigorous validation of AI models to ensure accuracy and transparency in AI decision-making and adherence to patient data privacy laws. This increased scrutiny will not only come from regulatory bodies but from patients themselves who may not trust it. 

When it comes to compliance, both in the EU and the US, smaller AI models and specialized models fall into different categories of regulation. This will prompt healthcare leaders to make use of lower-risk AI platforms that can adequately fulfill their needs. Specialized purpose-built AI solutions, sometimes known as narrow AI, can be developed to address specific medical challenges such as treatment planning and patient management. Unlike one-size-fits-all AI tools, these specialized solutions can be tailored to adhere to medical protocols and protect patient safety, making them more suitable for healthcare applications. 

This brings us to one of the most integral aspects of human-centric AI: explainability. 

The Rise of Explainable AI (XAI) 

With transparency being a priority, AI-driven diagnoses and treatment recommendations must be understandable, especially to patients who are already skeptical of the technology and often confused or distrustful towards healthcare insurance in general. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this need by providing clear insights into how decisions are made. 

By demystifying complex algorithms, XAI fosters trust between healthcare providers and their patients. This ensures that AI serves as a collaborative tool rather than an opaque authority, empowering medical professionals to confidently leverage its capabilities. 

Streamlined Referral Management 

Inefficiencies in referral management can lead to significant revenue losses, averaging between $821,000 and $971,000 per physician annually. 

For example, only half of faxed referrals result in an appointment, leading to patient leakage, care delays, and overall health outcomes degradation. 

In 2025, purpose-built AI will be used to fast-track appointments to see specialists. By applying AI technologies to the referral process, providers can automatically identify and extract handwritten and typed notes containing referral reasons to accurately prioritize urgent cases with respect to the strict data protection and auditability required in healthcare. This not only reduces delays and improves patient outcomes but also cuts overhead costs by approximately 50 percent while boosting revenue by 20 percent. 

AI Agents Provide Administrative Support 

Physicians spend nearly 30 percent of their day on administrative tasks, leading to widespread dissatisfaction and burnout. AI-driven automation will be a savior in 2025, taking over time-consuming duties like data entry, record processing and claim authorizations. 

When paired with human oversight, AI can unlock valuable insights from untapped data like handwritten notes, accelerating care delivery and enhancing the patient experience. Whether supporting emergency room staff or appointment schedulers, specialized AI adapts to a variety of workflows, easing the burden on healthcare professionals and allowing them to maintain their human touch with patients. 

Humanizing the AI-Powered Future 

In summary, AI will offer a transformative role in healthcare in 2025. By aligning technological advancements with human values, the healthcare industry is poised to create a future where innovation and empathy go hand-in-hand. 

In short, AI will require an infrastructure built on transparency and ethics to make sure that tech and humanity work together for better patient outcomes.
