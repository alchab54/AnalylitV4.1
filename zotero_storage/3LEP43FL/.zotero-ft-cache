ABSTRACT Introduction:
The Psychological Health Center of Excellence conducted a rapid review of the literature to investigate the effectiveness of behavioral health treatments (i.e., evidence-based psychotherapy and psychiatry) delivered in person compared to telehealth (TH; i.e., video teleconference and telephone).
Materials and Methods:
The rapid review methods included a systematic search of a single database (PubMed), hand-searching of relevant systematic reviews, dual screening, single-person data abstraction verified by a second person, and dual risk of bias assessment. Due to heterogeneity across studies, no quantitative analyses were conducted.
Results:
Twenty-two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), eight of which were non-inferiority trials, evaluated the effectiveness of TH via telephone or video teleconferencing compared to in-person (IP) delivery for patient populations with posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and mixed diagnoses. The majority of RCTs and all but one of the eight noninferiority trials found that clinical outcomes did not differ between TH and IP treatment delivery. Two studies found that subgroups with higher symptom severity (hopelessness and anxiety disorders, respectively) in the TH group had worse treatment-related outcomes than IP participants with similar symptom profiles. The majority of studies found no significant differences in satisfaction with care, quality of the therapeutic alliance, or study discontinuation between TH and IP groups.
Conclusion:
Based on evidence from 22 RCTs, the use of TH platforms, including video conference and telephone modalities, generally produces similar outcomes as face-to-face provision of psychotherapy and psychiatry services.
INTRODUCTION
The use of telehealth (TH) for the delivery of synchronous (real-time) behavioral health (BH) services has become increasingly popular. Both telepsychology (technological delivery of psychological treatment) and telepsychiatry (technological delivery of psychiatric services) delivered synchronously show promise for improving access to care and overcoming barriers to treatment.1 Stigma and practical matters, such as lack of transportation or difficulty getting time off from work, present barriers for accessing treatment.2 Furthermore, frequent military relocations and

overseas deployments may result in delays in seeking treatment or disruptions in treatment. Telehealth can improve access to care for service members deploying to areas distal from large or traditional healthcare facilities, provide greater flexibility in scheduling treatment, and reduce the stigma associated with being physically present in mental health clinics.3,4 Importantly, technological advances make this possible without compromising Department of Defense (DoD) security requirements.5 In the past, the use of TH has been limited in part because of privacy and security concerns.6 However, the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has restricted access to inperson (IP) care and has increased the impetus for offering TH services via telephone and video teleconference (VTC).7 Consistent with ongoing efforts by Medicare and private insurers to implement and reimburse for TH options for health visits, lawmakers have urged the availability of the full scope of TH services for mental health care in particular.8 This has prompted DoD BH leaders to consider policy changes and best practices for TH delivery of behavioral healthcare and medication management. With the goal of improving and standardizing TH practices in the military health system, DoD stakeholders requested a short-suspense review of the literature on the effectiveness of TH interventions for the treatment of BH disorders. This article summarizes a rapid review of the evidence conducted in response to this request.

Rapid Review on Effectiveness of Telehealth Interventions
Many research studies and systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of TH delivery of BH services9–11; however, most have focused on the use of self-guided computer-based or internet-delivered treatments where providers may have a limited role. Apaydin and colleagues12,13 created an evidence map which characterized the voluminous research literature on the use of TH for augmenting clinical care of depression and anxiety. This map showed that the majority of 280 reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TH interventions utilized computers. Studies on therapist-administered synchronous interventions (i.e., those occurring in real time) via telephone or VTC were less common; only 8% of TH RCTs evaluated telephone
delivery, while 2% focused on VTC.13 Of greater interest for this review is synchronous TH via telephone or VTC. Synchronous TH allows real-time interaction between patient and provider and, compared to other types of TH, is more similar to IP treatment.14 Several systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of synchronous telepsychology services yielded encouraging findings (Table I). Four systematic reviews assessed the effectiveness of interventions delivered over the telephone.14–17 However, those reviews included studies that compared telepsychology interventions to waiting list or treatment as usual, and did not exclusively compare telephone to IP delivery of the same treatment. Seven systematic reviews evaluated

Rapid Review on Effectiveness of Telehealth Interventions
the effectiveness of VTC delivery, with most reviews examining telepsychology interventions for depression or anxiety.14–22 Gentry et al.20 evaluated RCTs and open-label studies of TH group therapy and concluded that therapy delivered via VTC resulted in similar treatment outcomes as face-toface group therapy. Berryhill et al.18 also found that VTC did not differ from face-to-face delivery in the effectiveness of treatment for depression.19 One review of 11 studies found that face-to-face treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had larger treatment gains than VTC-delivered therapy.19 Telehealth treatments are comparable to IP therapy on ratings of treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance.23 However, therapy format (individual vs. group) affects perceptions of treatment experience for TH and IP patients.23 Thus, to optimize implementation of TH, it seems important to identify other factors that moderate the effects of TH on perception of and response to treatment. Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of telepsychiatry have yielded inconsistent findings from a limited number of reviews directly comparing TH to IP treatments.21,22 The current rapid review was designed to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of synchronous BH treatment delivered via TH compared to IP care and (2) determine whether certain patients benefit more from a specific modality. We addressed the following questions: (1) Are evidence-based behavioral healthcare interventions delivered via TH platforms (i.e., VTC and telephonic modalities) as effective as IP delivery of these treatments for a range of BH disorders? and (2) Is there any evidence to indicate whether TH treatment modalities are more appropriate for some patients and IP care for others?
METHODS
This rapid review comprised a systematic search of a single database, hand-searching of relevant systematic reviews, dual screening, single-person data abstraction verified by a second person, and dual risk of bias assessment. A search of PubMed was conducted on May 14, 2020, with no restriction on date. The search employed a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms for the concepts of: (1) mental health disorder; (2) psychotherapy or psychiatric intervention; and (3) TH. A fourth set of search terms was included to limit the results to RCTs. Search terms within a concept were combined with the Boolean Operator “OR” and concepts were linked with the Boolean Operator “AND.” The PubMed “19+” filter was applied to limit the search results to adult populations. Full search syntax is provided in Table S1. The reference sections of published systematic reviews on telepsychology and telepsychiatry were hand-searched to identify additional studies. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: peer-reviewed RCTs published in English, including adults with symptoms or diagnosis of any mental health disorder, comparing the same intervention (evidence-based psychotherapy or psychiatry) using different delivery modalities (face-toface, telephone, and VTC). We included both “office-based
VTC” (i.e., synchronous TH delivered by a provider in one clinical setting to patients located in a different satellite clinic) and “home-based VTC” (i.e., TH delivered by providers in a clinical setting to patients in their home environment). Table S2 describes the full inclusion and exclusion criteria. Titles and abstracts were dually screened by two subject matter experts, with disagreements resolved through discussion or consultation with a third person if required. Full-text articles were obtained for records included at the title/abstract stage and were screened dually using the same criteria. Following screening, articles were linked by study, and a single reviewer extracted study characteristics and results for each study using a previously piloted data extraction form. Extracted data were verified by a second reviewer. For each of the included studies, two reviewers independently completed the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment (considered the gold standard for assessing the risk of bias for RCTs)24 and resolved disagreements through discussion.
RESULTS
A total of 997 records were screened, yielding 22 primary RCTs reported in 42 publications that met inclusion criteria (see PRISMA flow diagram, Fig. 1). A description of study characteristics and main conclusions from both primary studies and secondary analyses is in Table II. Citations of included studies and risk of bias assessments are presented in Table S3 and Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Studies focused on populations with the following diagnoses: depression (41%), PTSD (41%), and mixed samples with various BH diagnoses (18%). More than half of the studies (55%) were conducted on veteran populations. Although one study included both veterans and active duty service members (AD SMs), no studies were conducted with an exclusively AD SM population. The majority of BH interventions (86%) were evidence-based psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), and behavioral activation (BA), while the remaining 14% were psychiatry treatments, encompassing medication management, psychoeducation, and/or supportive counseling. Most studies compared IP treatment delivery to officebased VTC (48%); the remainder comprised telephone (29%) and home-based VTC (24%) TH modalities. A single study compared home-based IP treatment with both office-based and home-based VTC. The types of TH modalities used in those studies included telephone (both on landlines and smartphones) and VTC via various technologies (e.g., analog videophone, PolyCom, and Personal Computer-based), either coordinated from a centralized to a distal satellite site or to the participant’s home.
Telehealth Psychotherapies for Depression
Eight RCTs reported on various evidence-based psychotherapies for depression, delivered either by telephone or home-based VTC (Table II). Four studies concluded that

telephone-administered CBT was both feasible and acceptable to patients with depression and resulted in similar or more favorable post-treatment effects on depressive symptoms when compared to IP delivery.25–28 Telehealth-delivered treatment resulted in greater improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms and global functioning,26 greater reductions in worry,29 and was more cost-effective than IP delivery in patients with depression.30 One study compared IP with home-based VTC treatment in depressed patients and generally found similar decreases in depression severity and other outcomes, regardless of method of delivery.31 Three studies were non-inferiority trials. A large noninferiority trial in patients with major depressive disorder found that telephone-delivered CBT was not worse than IP care at post-treatment, but that those who received IP treatment had comparatively lower depression scores at 6-month follow-up.32 In one study of older veterans,
behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) via VTC was not worse than IP treatment delivery for depressive symptoms, quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with care, and costs.33 The results from the other study, with a predominantly AD SM sample, found that although depression and hopelessness decreased in both groups (VTC and IP BATD), the magnitude of decrease was less pronounced in the TH group and, therefore, the results did not support non-inferiority of TH compared to IP treatment.34
Telehealth Psychotherapies for PTSD
Nine RCTs evaluated evidence-based psychotherapies for the treatment of PTSD and related symptoms. Two RCTs showed that VTC-delivered therapy was as good as IP therapy at decreasing PTSD symptoms.35,36 However, in one of these studies with prolonged exposure therapy in

veterans with PTSD, TH participants had substantially higher discontinuation rates and comparatively worse depression than the IP group at post-treatment and follow-up.36 Five non-inferiority trials (three evaluating CPT, two BA, and one prolonged exposure) concluded that office-based VTC45,47,48 or home-based VTC49,52 were non-inferior to IP treatment in improving PTSD symptoms at post-treatment. Several studies concluded that there were no significant differences between modalities in improving secondary depressive symptoms48,52 or QoL45 in cohorts of participants with PTSD.
Telehealth Psychotherapies for Various Behavioral Health Diagnoses
Two studies found that psychotherapy delivered via officebased VTC produced similar outcomes as IP therapy in patient populations with various BH diagnoses.55,56 For individuals with various mood and anxiety disorders, both treatment modalities reduced anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms and improved QoL.56 Therapy delivered via office-based VTC to patients with eating disorders improved binge eating episodes and purging frequency similar to improvements among those receiving IP therapy55; however, participants who received IP treatment had greater decreases in depression and purging frequency at 12-month follow-up than those receiving VTC.61
Psychiatric Treatment via Telehealth
Several RCTs57–59 provided evidence that telepsychiatry delivered by office-based VTC to individuals with various BH diagnoses produced similar outcomes as OP treatment (Table II). Ruskin and colleagues reported that there were no differences in symptom improvement, remission, treatment adherence, or satisfaction among veterans with various depressive diagnoses who received telepsychiatry or IP psychiatric services.59 One study found that psychiatric treatment delivered by VTC was less costly and more costeffective than IP treatment,58 while another study found that office-based VTC expenses were higher than IP treatment costs.59
Variables Associated with Differences between Groups
The second key question in this rapid review was to identify any variables associated with differential effects between IP and TH delivery. To answer this question, we examined studies that compared TH to IP delivery on predictors of treatment response, satisfaction with care, quality of the therapeutic alliance, and study discontinuation rates.
Predictors of Treatment Response
Two studies evaluated symptom severity and mental health comorbidities as predictors of treatment response in TH compared to IP modality.32,43 In a study of veterans with
depressive disorders, participants with higher hopelessness symptoms at baseline who received therapy via VTC improved less than those receiving IP treatment,34 whereas in the subgroup with lower baseline hopelessness scores, there were no significant differences in change over time between the two modalities.43 The authors noted that these findings also might have been attributable to age differences between the groups, as participants with higher loneliness and anxiety scores at baseline tended to be older.43 In another study analyzing the effects of comorbidities on treatment response, there were no significant differences between telephone and IP therapy delivered to depressed patients without concurrent anxiety disorders.32 However, participants with comorbid depression and anxiety disorders who received telephone-delivered therapy had significantly poorer outcomes on depression and anxiety symptoms at treatment end and follow-up relative to the IP group.38 Two studies that evaluated the effects of moderator variables such as sex, race, income, and age found no significant moderator-by-modality interaction on clinical outcomes.32,33
Satisfaction with Services and Therapeutic Alliance
Nine of 11 studies that measured satisfaction with care found no differences between participants in TH and IP groups, suggesting that the mode of delivering services did not adversely affect participants’ overall satisfaction. In the two studies that found between-group differences, satisfaction was higher in the IP group in one47 and higher in the TH group in the other.53 One study evaluated associations between satisfaction ratings and demographic variables in a mixed AD SM and veteran population. Higher satisfaction with IP treatment was associated with younger age and more junior military status, whereas greater satisfaction with in-home TH delivery was associated with older, more symptomatic participants.42 Eight studies examined differences in participants’ perceptions of the quality of the therapeutic alliance. In all eight studies, across varied diagnoses (PTSD, major depressive disorder, and mood, anxiety, and eating disorders), there were no differences in participants’ perceptions of the quality of the client–therapist relationship between modali
ties.26,28,32,35,45,47,56,60
Discontinuation Rates
Fifteen of 17 studies that examined differences in rates of study discontinuation (i.e., participant withdrawal from the study for any reason or failure to complete treatment per protocol) found no significant differences between the TH and IP groups. Two studies found significant between-group differences with mixed results. One study showed higher TH discontinuation rates among veterans with PTSD (officebased VTC, 54%; home-based VTC, 38%; IP in home, 21%). The authors attributed the higher dropout rate in the office-based group to barriers associated with traveling to the clinic and to technological problems that required information

technology support.36 Conversely, among patients receiving CBT for major depression, Mohr and colleagues found higher discontinuation rates in the IP than in the telephone group (32.7% vs. 20.9%) and conjectured that higher adherence in the telephone group was related to overcoming access barriers.32
DISCUSSION
Twenty-two RCTs evaluated TH delivery compared to IP delivery of BH treatment for patients with PTSD, depression, and mixed BH conditions. It was notable that more than half of the included trials were conducted in veterans, with a substantial proportion of studies evaluating TH treatments for PTSD. The results from the majority of studies found that the clinical outcomes of TH delivered via telephone or VTC were similar to IP service delivery. In addition, we identified eight non-inferiority trials. Because we focused on evidence-based psychotherapies with strong recommendations supporting their use for the management of PTSD and major depressive disorder,62,63 the evidence from non-inferiority trials was considered acceptable.64 Seven of the eight non-inferiority trials included in this review, across varied diagnoses and evidence-based psychotherapies, concluded that TH delivery was “as good as” IP delivery. Interestingly, several studies found that TH treatment for depression resulted in more favorable outcomes compared to IP delivery on several measures. Satisfaction with services, therapeutic alliance, and discontinuation rates were similar in both TH and IP modalities. Although the post-treatment effects of TH were favorable, there were variations in whether these outcomes were sustained over time. Furthermore, TH treatment may not be suitable for all patients. For instance, two studies showed that patients with higher symptom severity and mental health comorbidities had worse treatment outcomes in the TH compared to the IP modality. Future TH protocols may need to consider symptom severity, comorbidity, and other relevant variables when determining the appropriateness of TH for particular patients. The reviewed RCTs included subjects from many demographic groups, including combat veterans, Latino primary care patients, active duty service members, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected urban patients with depression, increasing the generalizability of the findings. The results of this rapid review are consistent with prior systematic reviews evaluating synchronous treatments via TH.14–18,22,23 Telehealth has been shown to have a number of advantages over IP treatment, including cost savings and costeffectiveness.30,58,61 For active duty military personnel who frequently relocate and/or are deployed, TH has the potential to provide continuity of care with a consistent provider. However, TH may not be optimal for all patients, as lack of privacy, technical difficulties,34 and other factors may affect willingness to engage in and continue therapy. Adequate equipment
testing should precede the delivery of TH services so that they can be implemented as seamlessly as possible.
Limitations
Several limitations are worth noting. Due to wide heterogeneity across studies (i.e., different evidence-based therapies, TH conditions, outcome measures, and populations), we opted against meta-analytic synthesis of results and grading of the evidence. Instead, we relied on a narrative synthesis and we interpreted results based on the reported statistical significance testing. In addition, since rapid reviews focus on a targeted research question and curtailed pool of research literature, the process may omit relevant research studies. We attempted to minimize this risk of omission by hand-searching systematic reviews on the topic.
Future Directions
We identified a number of research gaps that should be addressed in future research. Although VTC has gained increasing popularity, about one-third of trials evaluated telephone-delivered care. Although both TH modalities appeared to be equally effective as IP care, it is worth evaluating whether either TH modality results in better patient engagement and treatment outcomes. In the current climate where coronavirus disease 2019 restricts access to IP care, a choice between telephone and VTC for treatment delivery is potentially important. We did not identify any studies that directly compared these different TH modalities. Given that most studies found no differences between either TH modality compared to IP treatment, one may speculate that these different TH modalities are comparable. However, research is needed to substantiate this observation. Most studies evaluated outcomes at post-treatment. When available, we reported the results of longer-term follow-ups. However, because most studies did not evaluate long-term effects, it was unclear whether the effects of TH treatment persisted over time. Future studies should evaluate long-term effects of TH treatment. None of the studies addressed legal or ethical concerns associated with telepsychiatry, such as the requirement for one IP visit before prescribing, prescribing controlled substances remotely, and prescribing across state lines. These concerns will have to be addressed before implementation of telepsychiatry. Only two studies evaluated the effects of participants’ clinical characteristics on treatment response, finding that patients with higher symptom severity and those with mental health comorbidities may be better suited to IP treatment. More research is needed to examine the moderating effects of clinical characteristics and other individual variables. In circumstances where TH is the only available option, it may be necessary to determine ways to optimize treatment for clients with higher symptom severity and mental health comorbidities. Furthermore, future research should examine how patients’ preferences and ease of use with a particular TH modality may influence treatment outcomes.

Rapid Review on Effectiveness of Telehealth Interventions
CONCLUSIONS
Empirical evidence supports the use and implementation of TH in the military health system as a modality for providing BH interventions, including evidence-based psychotherapies and psychiatric treatments. The equivalence of TH to IP care has been established in multiple settings, with a number of psychological conditions, and across broad demographic categories, including military and veteran populations. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of TH and determine types of clients best suited for that treatment modality.
