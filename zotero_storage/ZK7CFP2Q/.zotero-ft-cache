Abstract
Background: A strong cooperative bond between the patient and provider (“thera
peutic alliance”) is robustly associated with better alcohol use disorder (AUD) treat
ment outcomes. Although digital treatments for AUD have significant potential, the
function of the alliance during digital programs is unclear. We compared the validity
of patient-reported measures of the alliance with a digital treatment (“digital alliance”)
for AUD and the alliance with their clinician (“clinician alliance”).
Methods: We used data from an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of a computer
ized cognitive behavioral therapy program (CBT4CBT) during outpatient AUD treat
ment. Treatment conditions included CBT4CBT with minimal clinical monitoring
(CBT4CBT + monitor) or with treatment as usual (CBT4CBT + TAU). The digital alliance
and clinician alliance were measured with similar versions of the Working Alliance
Inventory (WAI). The WAI ratings were completed at the 2nd and 6th treatment ses
sions. A timeline followback calendar assessed daily alcohol use. Bayesian multilevel
models compared the strength of the alliances and tested their associations with fu
ture alcohol use.
Results: Data from 43 participants were included (age M = 44; 65% male; 51% Black,
40% White, 9% other; 14% Hispanic). The digital alliance ratings had similar inter
nal reliability as the clinician alliance ratings (ω's > 0.90). Differences between digi
tal alliance and clinician alliance ratings were negligible in both treatment conditions
(BF01 = 9 and 31). During treatment, within-person increases in the digital alliance and
the clinician alliance predicted modest decreases in future drinking to a similar degree
(BF01 = 15). Alliance ratings were not associated with future drinking when posttreat 
ment follow-up drinking data were included (BF10 < 3).
Conclusions: The digital alliance with CBT4CBT was comparable to the clinician alli
ance. The digital alliance and clinician alliance had similar, albeit very small, associa
tions with abstinence during treatment. Future research can explore how the digital
alliance develops to improve AUD treatment efficacy.

INTRODUCTION
The therapeutic alliance (“alliance”) is considered a core affiliative so
cial process in psychiatric treatment. The alliance describes the co
operative bond between the patient and provider, including mutual
trust and agreement with the treatment goals and tasks (Flückiger
et al., 2018; Wampold, 2015). A stronger alliance is robustly asso
ciated with better treatment outcomes for substance use disorder
(Connors et al., 2016; Meier et al., 2005; Miller & Moyers, 2015).
Changes in the alliance during treatment often precede improve
ments in a variety of clinical outcomes, indicating that the alliance
is temporally dynamic and potentially a vital treatment mechanism
(Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022). The relationship between the alliance
and psychiatric symptoms is likely reciprocal, where increasing the
alliance improves symptoms and improving symptoms increases the
alliance (Falkenström et al., 2013; Flückiger et al., 2020). This recip
rocal relationship may be reflected in the underlying neurobiology
of addiction, since the same corticolimbic circuits are broadly impli 
cated in both social processes and addiction (de Wit & Sayette, 2018;
Goldman et al., 2010; Heilig et al., 2016; Venniro et al., 2018). Thus,
multiple domains of research indicate that the alliance may be instru 
mental to the treatment of addictive behaviors, including alcohol use
disorder (AUD).
However, conceptualizations of the alliance have been compli
cated by technological advances in treatment delivery (Lederman
& D'Alfonso, 2021). Digital health tools for AUD, including mobile
apps and web-based programs, have significant therapeutic poten
tial (Carroll & Kiluk, 2017). But it is unclear how the alliance with
a digital treatment program compares to the alliance with a human
clinician. If the alliance is defined as requiring interpersonal interac 
tion, then digital treatments may deliver specific treatment compo 
nents (e.g., coping skills) without any alliance (Carroll & Kiluk, 2017).
Alternatively, some researchers posit a “digital therapeutic alliance”
to describe the quality of the therapeutic connection that patients
form with digital treatments (D'Alfonso et al., 2020). A digital alliance
consists of the patient's emotional engagement and agreement with
the content portrayed by the digital treatment. For instance, Com
puter Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT) is
a digital treatment that teaches CBT skills for avoiding substance use
through didactic material and video vignettes (Carroll et al., 2008;
Carroll & Kiluk, 2017). In these videos, professional actors portray
protagonists with substance use disorders who face emotionally
arousing situations often experienced by patients (e.g., interpersonal
conflict; financial stressors). A patient's connection with the protag
onists and trust that the CBT skills will reduce substance use could
characterize an alliance with CBT4CBT. Therefore, a digital alliance
is conceptually plausible as a variation of traditional formulations of
the alliance.
Theoretical and empirical lines of evidence suggest that pa
tients can form an alliance with digital treatments for AUD. The
human capacity for affiliative bonding can extend to attachments
with non-human species and socially significant objects (e.g., pets,
religious symbols, and heirlooms), which can promote survival
(Feldman, 2017; Moll & de Oliveira-Souza, 2009). Affiliative social
experiences may also be elicited without any human interaction by
simply viewing digital media that portray social content (Bortolini
et al., 2021; Eslinger et al., 2021; Schilbach et al., 2013). Within the
clinical domain, quantitative measures of the alliance with digital
interventions have already been demonstrated in several studies
(Kiluk et al., 2014; Lederman & D'Alfonso, 2021). Consequently, the
plausibility of an alliance with digital interventions has been sup
ported by both theory and empirical evidence.
An open question is whether the digital alliance functions sim
ilarly to the alliance with a clinician during AUD treatment. Similar
functioning between the digital alliance and the alliance with a cli
nician could be demonstrated by comparable performance on em 
pirical indicators of construct validity. A recent review suggested
that the digital alliance may not be directly related to treatment out
comes, although few studies have explored this question (D'Alfonso
et al., 2020). In our previous study evaluating participants' digital
alliance with CBT4CBT, we did not find a statistically significant cor
relation between the digital alliance early in treatment and future
cocaine abstinence (Kiluk et al., 2014). Notably, participants in that
study self-reported a slightly lower bond with CBT4CBT compared
to their bond with clinicians. Mean alliance ratings were somewhat
stable over time; however, the association between outcomes and
changes in the alliance over time was not directly tested. Investigat
ing individual changes over time would be consistent with concep
tualizing the alliance as a temporally dynamic treatment mechanism,
rather than a fixed set of relational characteristics (Zilcha-Mano &
Fisher, 2022). In the present study, we investigate how within-person
longitudinal changes in the digital alliance relate to AUD treatment
outcomes. We compared the reliability, mean ratings, and predictive
accuracy of measures of the digital alliance with CBT4CBT and the
alliance with clinicians during treatment for AUD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analyses were conducted using data from a randomized clinical
trial of treatments for AUD in an adult outpatient setting (Kiluk
et al., 2016). All individuals seeking treatment for their alcohol use
at an outpatient community facility that specialized in treatment for
substance use disorders were invited to participate in the trial. Eligi
bility included being at least 18 years old, fluent in English, and meet
ing DSM-IV criteria for current alcohol abuse/dependence (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994). Sixty-eight participants were ran
domly assigned to one of three treatment conditions delivered over
an 8-week period: treatment as usual (TAU), CBT4CBT + TAU, or
CBT4CBT + brief clinical monitoring (“monitor”). The “monitor” com
ponent consisted of a clinician's 10-minute weekly in-person review
of the patient's functioning, safety, and use of CBT4CBT. TAU in
cluded weekly in-person individual and/or group therapy sessions
with clinicians. Described in detail elsewhere (Kiluk et al., 2016),
CBT4CBT consists of seven modules that each cover a core CBT
skill (e.g., functional analysis; thought challenging; problem solving).

THE CONNECTION STILL MATTERS
Participants were asked to complete one module per week on a com
puter in the clinic. Each module took about 35 minutes to complete.
Modules included didactive instruction and emotionally arousing
video vignettes portraying the use of CBT skills during high-risk situ
ations for alcohol use.
Forty-six participants were randomized to one of the CBT4CBT
conditions. The current analyses use data from 43 of these partici
pants who completed the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) at least
once. In this subsample, 24 were assigned to CBT4CBT + monitor,
and 19 were assigned to CBT4CBT + TAU. The mean age was 44
(SD = 12) and 65% were male. Most participants were Black (51%) or
White (40%), and 14% identified as Hispanic.
Measures
Therapeutic alliance
Participants rated their alliance using the Working Alliance Inven
tory (Horvath & Greenberg, 1989). The WAI is comprised of 36 items
that form 3 subscales measuring the strength of endorsement of the
therapeutic tasks, goals, and bond with the clinician. Items are rated
on a 7-point scale and averaged across items within each subscale.
Since ratings on the 3 subscales are often highly correlated, they are
typically combined into a mean total rating that is interpreted as the
overall strength of the alliance (Falkenström et al., 2013; Horvath &
Greenberg, 1989).
Participants completed separate WAI ratings for their alliance
with the CBT4CBT program (“digital alliance”) and their alliance with
their clinician (“clinician alliance”). Both versions of the WAI were
completed at sessions 2 and 6 during the 8-week treatment period.
Participants in the CBT4CBT + monitor condition reported their al
liance with their clinical monitor, since they did not have a formal
therapist. Validation of the digital alliance version of the WAI has
been described in a prior report (Kiluk et al., 2014). For the digital
alliance version, the standard WAI was modified such that items
identified the computer program rather than the participant's ther
apist (e.g., “I am confident in the computer program's ability to help
me”), and instructions specified that items referred to the CBT4CBT
program, not the computer itself or the research team. Results from
a prior CBT4CBT trial showed that participants total ratings for their
digital alliance were comparable to the total ratings for their clinician
alliance (Kiluk et al., 2014). But the bond subscale of their digital al
liance was rated lower than the bond subscale of their clinician alli
ance. Therefore, in this study, we first conducted analyses with the
total WAI ratings and then repeated these analyses using only the
WAI bond subscale ratings.
The WAI total ratings of the digital alliance and clinician alliance
were strongly correlated in both treatment conditions at session 2
(CBT4CBT + monitor r = 0.94; CBT4CBT + TAU r = 0.78) and session
6 (CBT4CBT + monitor r = 0.77; CBT4CBT + TAU r = 0.68). Similarly,
the WAI bond ratings of the digital alliance and clinician alliance
were strongly correlated in both treatment conditions at session 2
(CBT4CBT + monitor r = 0.86 vs. CBT4CBT + TAU r = 0.59) and ses
sion 6 (CBT4CBT + monitor r = 0.72 vs. CBT4CBT + TAU r = 0.67).
Alcohol use
Daily alcohol use was self-reported using a timeline followback cal
endar at baseline, each week in therapy, and posttreatment follow
ups at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months (Sobell et al., 1988). Each
day was coded as either a drinking day=( 1) or not a drinking day (= 0).
If an assessment was missed, then the next followback calendar as
sessment would also cover the missed days. The daily drinking data
were linked to the most recently completed alliance assessment.
That is, each alliance assessment was matched to drinking data that
were reported only after the date when the alliance was measured.
This data structure established temporal precedence, such that al
liance ratings were always predicting future drinking (i.e., session 2
ratings predicted drinking between sessions 2 and 6; session 6 rat
ings predicted drinking between sessions 6 and 8). To evaluate the
durability of any associations between alliance ratings and drinking
outcomes, separate analyses were conducted that included drink
ing data collected during the follow-up period (i.e., session 6 alliance
ratings predicted drinking between session 6 and the end of the
6-month follow-up period). Drinking data collected between treat
ment initiation and the first alliance assessment at session 2 were
used as a covariate in the models predicting drinking outcomes. At
baseline, all participants reported consuming alcohol at least once
during the 28 days prior to study enrollment. The mean number of
days participants had consumed alcohol during the 28 days prior to
enrollment was 13 (SD = 9; Med = 12).
Alcohol use disorder symptoms
Baseline AUD severity was measured using the Alcohol Use Disor
der Identification Test (Babor et al., 2001). The mean AUDIT score
was 18.37 (SD = 7.97; Med = 17), indicating that most participants
had moderate or severe AUD symptoms.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted using the R statistical software (R Core
Team, 2021). Internal consistency estimates for the digital alliance
and the clinician alliance were generated using McDonald's ω and av
erage interitem correlations, rij. We then compared mean differences
in the strength of endorsement between the digital alliance and
the clinician alliance using Bayesian linear multilevel models. Since
participants completed both WAI versions at two timepoints, the
models specified that the alliance ratings were nested within partici
pants. Predictors in the models included type of alliance (digital vs.
clinician), treatment condition (CBT4CBT + TAU vs. CBT4CBT + mon
itor), timepoint, age, gender, AUDIT score, and proportion of days

drinking during the treatment period. An interaction between type
of alliance and treatment condition was specified, since the alliance
may depend on the extent of adjunctive clinical contact.
To test whether digital alliance ratings were negligibly lower
than clinician alliance ratings, one-sided directional hypotheses
were specified. One-sided hypothesis tests are preferred in Bayes
ian inference when there is scientific rationale for testing a specific
alternative hypothesis against a null hypothesis (Keysers et al., 2020;
van Doorn et al., 2021). We defined a negligible difference as 0.10 or
less on the 7-point WAI scales, which roughly reflects a difference
of 0.10 SD units in the WAI scales (see Table 1). A standardized dif
ference of 0.10 is half the magnitude of the “small” Cohen's d effect
size (Kruschke, 2018). Bayes factors compared the posterior odds
favoring negligible differences given the data relative to the prior
odds, BF01 (Makowski, Ben-Shachar, Chen, & Lüdecke, 2019). Larger
BF01 values indicate evidence that favors negligible differences in b
values (b ∈ [−0.10, 0]). We interpreted all Bayes factors using Jef 
freys' evidence categories, which suggest that values greater than 3
substantially support a hypothesis (Wetzels et al., 2011). The prior
distributions were informed by the maximum differences between
the digital alliance and clinician alliance found in our previous study
(Kiluk et al., 2014). Normal prior distributions were specified for
the differences between mean alliance ratings for the total scale
N (M = 0.24, SD = 2.50) and for the bond subscale N (M = 0.56,
SD = 2.50). The means of these prior distributions reflect slightly
higher mean clinician alliance ratings than mean digital alliance rat
ings, as found in the previous study. The standard deviations indicate
that differences greater than 5.00 are very unlikely since the maxi
mum possible difference on the WAI scales is 6.00. For all other co 
variates, we specified normal distributions with M = 0 and SD = 2.50.
These models directly tested the evidence supporting negligible
differences between the strength of the digital alliance and the cli
nician alliance.
To compare the predictive validity of the digital alliance and cli
nician alliance, daily drinking data during treatment were matched
to the most recently completed alliance ratings. To ensure alliance
ratings predicted only future drinking, drinking data between treat
ment initiation and the first alliance assessment were included as
a covariate in the models, but not in the outcome variable. Bayes
ian logistic multilevel models nested daily drinking observations
within participants. Covariates included type of alliance, treatment
condition, weekend (Friday and Saturday vs. other days), days since
study enrollment, age, gender, AUDIT score, and the proportion of
days drinking between treatment initiation and the first alliance
assessment. A logistic regression on dichotomized drinking data
was used because 73% of the timeline followback calendar days
recorded 0 drinks consumed, indicating a non-normal distribution
of drinking counts. Alliance ratings were included in the model as
both between-person and within-person predictors. The between
person alliance predictor was the participant's mean rating across
both timepoints. The within-person predictor was the alliance rat
ing at each timepoint subtracted from the participant's mean rating.
For example, a participant who rated a 4 at the first timepoint and
a 7 at the second timepoint would have a between-person alliance
rating of 5.50 at both timepoints. Their within-person alliance rat
ings would be −1.50 for the first timepoint and 1.50 for the second
timepoint. Both the between-person and within-person alliance pre
dictors were included in the same models, with each being modeled
as an interaction with the type of alliance. These interactions com
pared the associations between drinking and alliance ratings by the
type of alliance (digital vs. clinician).
To determine if the digital alliance was less predictive of drink
ing than the clinician alliance, one- sided directional hypotheses
were specified. We first tested for negative associations between
each type of alliance and future drinking. These hypotheses were
tested with Bayes Factors comparing the proportion of the poste
rior distribution that was negative versus positive ( BF10; b < 0 vs.
b > 0). Larger BF10 values indicate evidence that favors negative
b values (i.e., a negative association between the alliance and fu 
ture drinking). Along with the BF10 values, we report regression
coefficients and two-sided, equal-tailed 95% credibility inter
vals for the associations between alliance ratings and drinking.
If the directional hypothesis test indicated an association, then
we conducted two-sided hypothesis tests to assess the magni
tude of the association between the alliance and drinking. These
two-sided hypotheses were tested with Bayes Factors comparing

THE CONNECTION STILL MATTERS
the posterior odds relative to the prior odds favoring a negligi 
bly small association between alliance ratings and future drink
ing, BF01 (Makowski, Ben-Shachar, Chen, & Lüdecke, 2019). Larger
BF01 values indicate evidence that favors negligibly small log odds
coefficients (b ∈ [−0.18, 0.18]). Log odds values of −0.18 and 0.18
correspond to Cohen's d values of −0.10 and 0.10, which are half
the magnitude of the frequently cited “small” effect size bench 
marks of d = 0.20 and −0.20. To assess whether the association
between the digital alliance and future drinking was weaker than
the association between the clinician alliance and future drinking,
we defined a negligible difference between these coefficients as a
log odds difference of −0.18 or less. Bayes factors for these direc
tional hypotheses compared the posterior odds favoring negligible
differences in b values relative to the prior odds, BF01. Larger BF01
values indicate evidence that favors negligibly small differences
in log odds coefficients (b ∈ [−0.18, 0]). The prior distributions
were informed by previous research showing small to moderately
sized correlations between alliance ratings and substance use out
comes (Kiluk et al., 2014; Miller & Moyers, 2015). Normal prior
distributions were specified for the within- person and between
person alliance regression coefficients: N (M = −0.50, SD = 2.50).
The means of these prior distributions reflect a modest negative
association between alliance ratings and drinking ( r = −0.14, con
verted to −0.50 log odds). The standard deviations indicate that
extremely strong associations (r's > 0.80 and < −0.80) are very un
likely. For all other covariates, we specified normal distributions
with M = 0 and SD = 2.50.
To check the robustness of our results, we reanalyzed the data
using alternative models with different prior distributions. Normal
prior distributions with M = 0 and SD = 1 were specified for all the
predictors, and numeric variables were standardized as z- scores
(Lemoine, 2019). We report in the results one instance when these
alternative standardized models produced a different conclusion
from the initial models. Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC)
generated from unconditional models assessed the proportion of
variance in each outcome variable attributable to within- person
changes. Potential bias due to missing data was addressed using
multilevel multiple imputation (Grund et al., 2018). The number
of imputed datasets was determined by the percentage of missing
data. Separate imputation datasets were generated for each type
of alliance and then merged to preserve any potential interaction
effects. All covariates from the Bayesian models were included in
the imputation process. Predictors were included as fixed effects.
Random intercepts were specified in the models predicting alli 
ance ratings. Random intercepts and random slopes for the num 
ber of days since study enrollment were specified in the models
predicting drinking.
Bayesian analyses were used because they can directly test
whether the data supports “null” findings (e.g., negligible differences,
practical equivalence, etc.). Simulation research indicates that Bayes
factor testing of the region of practical equivalence has more sta
tistical power for detecting negligible differences than a frequentist
method (Linde et al., 2021). The Bayesian models were implemented
in R with the brms package (Version 2.17) (Bürkner, 2017). Negligible
differences were tested in these models using the emmeans (Ver
sion 1.8.3) and the bayestestR package (Version 0.12.1) (Lenth, 2016;
Makowski, Ben-Shachar, & Lüdecke, 2019). Model fit compari
sons were made using the widely applicable information criterion
(WAIC) estimates from the loo package (Version 2.5.1) (Vehtari
et al., 2017). ICC estimates were generated using the performance
package (Version 0.7.3) (Lüdecke et al., 2021). Multiple imputation
was conducted with the mice package (Version 3.14) (van Buuren
& Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). The internal consistency estimates
were obtained using the psych package (Version 2.2.9) (Revelle &
Condon, 2019).
R E S U LT S
Prior to multiple imputation, a total of 132 alliance assessments
and 2369 daily timeline followback data points (9145 including data
during follow-up period) were available for analyses. Twenty-two
participants completed ratings of their clinician alliance at both time
points, 19 completed the ratings only once, and 2 did not complete
the ratings at either timepoint. Twenty-six participants completed
ratings of their digital alliance at both timepoints, and 17 completed
the ratings only once. Descriptive statistics and internal consistency
estimates for the alliance measures showed similarities between the
digital alliance and clinician alliance (Table 1). Both alliance measures
demonstrated high internal consistency. Within-person changes ac
counted for 28% of the variance in the alliance total scale ratings
(ICC = 0.72), 39% of the variance in the alliance bond subscale rat
ings (ICC = 0.61), and 29% of the variance in drinking (ICC = 0.71).
Diagnostic measures suggested that the parameters had converged
across all the models (r values < 1.04).
For the alliance total scale, the strength of the digital alliance
and clinician alliance was negligibly different in both treatment con
ditions (Figure 1; CBT4CBT + monitor, BF01 = 9; CBT4CBT + TAU,
BF01 = 31). For the alliance bond subscale, the strength of the dig
ital alliance and clinician alliance was also negligibly different in
both treatment conditions (Figure 1; CBT4CBT + monitor, BF01 = 7;
CBT4CBT + TAU, BF01 = 11). The alternative model did not substan
tially support negligible differences in the strength of the bond sub
scales for the CBT4CBT + monitor condition (BF01 = 2). However, the
alternative models did substantially support all the other negligible
differences in the strength of the alliances (BF01 > 3).
During the days between the first alliance assessment and the
end of treatment, alcohol use was reported on 27% of the days.
Figure 2 displays bubble charts of the raw data showing that in 
creases in alliance ratings were associated with decreased drinking
during the 8-week treatment period. A model with a random slope
for the number of days since study enrollment showed improved fit

the alliance total scale, future alcohol use was negatively associ

suggested that the associations with future drinking were negligibly
small for both the digital alliance (BF01 = 7) and the clinician alliance
(BF01 = 10). Furthermore, the difference in the magnitudes of these
associations between drinking and within-person changes in the
digital and clinician alliance total scales was negligible (BF01 = 15).
For the alliance total scale, future alcohol use was not negatively
associated with between-person differences in the digital alliance

the magnitudes of these associations between drinking and within
person changes in the digital and clinician alliance total scales was
negligible (BF01 = 15). For the alliance bond subscale, future alcohol
use was not negatively associated with between- person differ
ences in the digital alliance (Figure 4; b = 0.08, 95% CI[−0.26, 0.42],
BF10 = 0.48) and the clinician alliance (b = −0.01, 95% CI[−0.39, 0.36],

associations between drinking and between-person differences in
the alliance bond subscales (BF01 = 22). The alternative models sub
stantially supported all the same negligible differences (BF01 > 3).
When including all drinking data collected during the treatment
period and the 6-month follow-up period, alcohol use was reported
on 25% of the days. For the alliance total scale, future alcohol use
was no longer negatively associated with within-person increases
in the digital alliance (b = −0.04, 95% CI[−0.35, 0.20], BF10 = 1) nor
the clinician alliance (b = −0.05, 95% CI[−0.34, 0.17], BF10 = 2). There
was a negligible difference in the magnitude of these associations
between drinking and within-person changes in the alliance total

was no longer negatively associated with within-person increases

the clinician alliance (b = −0.06, 95% CI[−0.33, 0.26], BF10 = 2). There
was a negligible difference in the magnitude of these associations
between drinking and within-person changes in the alliance bond
subscale (BF01 = 38). Between-person differences in alliance total
ratings and bond ratings were not negatively associated with future
drinking (BF10 < 3). The alternative models also did not support neg
ative associations between alliance ratings and future drinking when
drinking data from the follow-up period were included (BF10 < 3).
DISCUSSION
We compared the internal reliability, mean ratings, and predictive
validity of patient-reported measures of their alliance with clinicians
and with a digital treatment for AUD (CBT4CBT). Participants rated
the strength of their digital alliance at a comparable level to their
clinician alliance. Ratings of the digital alliance and clinician alliance
also had comparably high levels of internal consistency. During the
treatment period, increases in the digital alliance over time predicted
modest decreases in future drinking to a similar degree as increases
in the clinician alliance over time. When the bond subscale of the al
liance measure was analyzed separately, the results mirrored those
of the total alliance scale. However, the weak associations between
alliance ratings (both digital and clinician) and future drinking were
not maintained when drinking data collected during a 6-month fol
low-up period were included in the analyses. These results suggest
that the digital alliance may function similarly to the alliance with
clinicians during AUD treatment, although the relationship to drink
ing outcomes is modest.
Our findings provided some evidence that a digital alliance
may be a significant component of ongoing AUD treatment. When
participants reported a stronger alliance with CBT4CBT, they also
reported drinking less in the following weeks during treatment. A 1
point within-person increase in the digital alliance was prospectively
associated with a 32% decrease in the odds of drinking (log odds
b = −0.38). Notably, the association between future drinking and
the digital alliance was comparable to that of the alliance with cli
nicians (24% decrease in the odds of drinking). However, the results
suggested overall that the magnitude of the associations between
drinking during the treatment period and alliance ratings were neg
ligibly small for both the digital alliance and the alliance with a clini
cian. Furthermore, the small negative associations between alliance
ratings and future drinking were not maintained when drinking data
during the treatment follow-up period were included in the anal
yses. Therefore, the digital alliance may have a similar role as the
alliance with clinicians during the treatment of AUD, although the
importance of this role for promoting abstinence was modest in the
current study.
Results from the alliance bond subscales were also notable. Par
ticipants rated their bond formed with digital treatment at a similar
magnitude to their bond formed with their clinician. The strength
of the digital bond and the bond with clinicians also predicted fu
ture drinking to a similar, albeit negligibly small, degree during the
treatment period. The alliance bond subscale consists of trust (e.g.,
“I trust what _______ is doing for me”), confidence (e.g., “I am confi
dent in ________'s ability to help me”), and positive affect toward the
clinician or CBT4CBT program (e.g., “My interactions with _______
are positive”; “I feel uncomfortable with __________”). For the digital
alliance version, participants were explicitly instructed to rate the
CBT4CBT program itself, not the computer they used or any other
aspects of the clinical research setting. The digital bonding experi 
ence with CBT4CBT may be due to emotionally engaging with the
social content in the video vignettes, which portray familiar life
circumstances similar to those encountered by persons with AUD
(Eslinger et al., 2021; Feldman, 2017; McGaugh, 2018; Moll & de
Oliveira-Souza, 2009; Montoya et al., 2008, 2017; Phelps, 2006).
However, more research is needed to directly test how the bond
portion of a digital alliance may develop and influence treatment
outcomes (Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022).
Although most of the variance in the digital alliance ratings was
attributed to between-person differences, these between-person
differences did not prospectively predict drinking in our study. In
contrast, within-person changes in the digital alliance prospectively
predicted decreases in drinking during treatment, albeit to a mod 
est degree. These findings highlight the distinction between viewing
the alliance as a static relational characteristic versus a temporally
dynamic process that may influence outcomes (Connors et al., 2016;
Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022). Our findings suggest the potential
utility of differentiating between static and temporally dynamic per
spectives on the digital alliance.
A primary limitation of our study is the lack of experimental
control, which is common in therapeutic alliance research (Flücki
ger et al., 2018). Although the alliance temporally preceded drinking
in our statistical design, we did not randomly assign participants to
treatment components that may have differentially influenced the

digital alliance. Therefore, we cannot rule out possible extraneous
variables that simultaneously increase the alliance and decrease
drinking. We did, however, include potentially important confound
ers as covariates in our models (e.g., drinking levels early in treat
ment; alcohol use disorder severity at baseline). Another limitation
is that participants may have rated their digital alliance based on the
overall support they received from the research study, although wri-t
ten instructions on the questionnaire emphasized rating their expe
rience with only the CBT4CBT program and not the staff or setting.
The strong correlations between the ratings of the digital alliance
and clinician alliance may be evidence that it was difficult to rate
each component separately. Similarly, it is possible that the alliance
with CBT4CBT directly influenced the alliance with the therapist or
clinical monitor, and vice-versa. Another notable limitation is that we
did not detect any associations between alliance ratings and future
drinking when the analyses included drinking data collected during
the follow-up period. This finding may suggest that the alliance's in 
fluence on drinking is limited to near-term outcomes. However, this
finding may also be explained by the primary results of the clinical
trial, which showed that abstinence rates increased over time during
the 8-week treatment period, but not the follow-up period (Kiluk
et al., 2016). The plateauing of abstinence rates after the treatment
period suggests that reductions in drinking stabilized for most par
ticipants, potentially restricting the variance in drinking rates that
could be predicted in our models. Another methodological limitation
to our study is the amount of uncertainty in the statistical estimates
due to the modest sample size. Larger sample sizes could increase
the precision of the estimated association between the digital al
liance and future drinking. Since both digital alliance and clinician
alliance ratings were necessary for meaningful within-person com
parisons, data from the TAU only condition were excluded from our
analyses. The alliance with clinicians in the TAU only condition may
have differed from the treatment conditions that included CBT4CBT,
limiting the generalizability of our findings to standard TAU. Given
these limitations, our findings offer only preliminary evidence for
the role of an alliance in digital treatments for AUD.
Future transdisciplinary research may explore more precisely
how the alliance functions during digital treatment for AUD. Un
derstanding how patients cognitively process digital social content
would be especially useful, since social information is endowed
with intrinsic value due to its relevance for survival (Norris & Ca
cioppo, 2007; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2022; Phelps, 2006). For
CBT4CBT, this may include identifying which video vignettes are
most memorable, emotionally arousing, personally relevant, and
motivative of treatment activities (e.g., homework compliance). In 
vestigating how engagement with digital social content influences
neural pathways may provide further insights into the mechanisms
of digital treatments (Magill et al., 2020; Reese et al., 2021). Cul
turally adapted digital treatments, such as the Spanish-language
version of CBT4CBT, could also demonstrate how the digital alli
ance may depend upon what social information is valued within the
patient's milieu (Paris et al., 2018). These future directions also ne
cessitate more frequent measurement of the digital alliance, as they
all assume the alliance is temporally dynamic throughout treatment
(Connors et al., 2016; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022).
Our study indicates that dynamic changes in the strength of the
alliance may play an important role during digital treatments for
AUD, as well as in traditional treatment modalities. Future research
should explore how the digital alliance with computerized treatment
develops and functions to change motivation for drinking.
