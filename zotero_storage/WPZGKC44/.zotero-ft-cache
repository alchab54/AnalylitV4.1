There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the current and future use of Artificial Intelligence programmes in the delivery and monitoring of health care.

This report sets out how AI is being used in healthcare currently, how it could be used in the near future, and examines both the potential benefits and drawbacks with respect to patients, clinicians, and the efficiency of the overall healthcare system.

AI is only a tool – if implemented appropriately and effectively, it can improve outcomes; if not, it can worsen them.

An analysis of the benefits and risks of current and future AI implementation within healthcare.
