he therapeutic alliance is a consistent predictor of treatent outcome. In the present study, we examined whether e therapeutic alliance is associated with symptoms of cial anxiety along the course of internet-delivered cognive behavior therapy (ICBT) for social anxiety disorder AD). We examined data from a large treatment trial = 182) in which individuals with SAD reported on their cial anxiety and alliance with the therapist each week durg the treatment (for 11 weeks). We examined the total ariance in alliance as well as within- and betweendividual variances separately. Consistent with our ypotheses, we found that the total variance in alliance pre
icted the total variance in social anxiety in the following eek. In addition, we found that within-individual variance alliance was negatively associated with within-individual ariance in social anxiety (in the following week). Thus, eekly increases in alliances were associated with weekly ductions in social anxiety in the following week. Finally, e found that between-individual variance in alliance was ositively associated with between-individual variance in cial anxiety such that individuals who were more socially nxious created stronger alliances with their therapists over e course of treatment. Our findings suggest that the therpeutic alliance is important in ICBT for SAD, that separatg variance into within and between components may help entify different psychological processes, and that improvg within-individual alliance may lead to reductions in mptoms of social anxiety.

age and may become chronic in the absence treatment (Keller, 2006; Lijster et al., 2017; Stei & Stein, 2008). Moreover, SAD has a very larg impact on day-to-day life; it is associated with hig levels of distress, loneliness, and poor self-estee (Iancu et al., 2015; Oren-Yagoda et al., 202 and can interfere with work, school, and social lif (Aderka et al., 2012).
treatment for sad
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been foun to be effective in the treatment of SAD (May Wilson et al., 2014). In fact, a meta-analys including 101 randomized-controlled treatme trials found that individual CBT had the large effect size of any single psychological or pharm cological treatment (standardized mean differenc compared to waitlist = 1.19; Mayo-Wilso et al., 2014). One medium for administerin CBT that has become increasingly used over th last decade is internet-delivered CBT (ICB Andersson, 2016; Carlbring et al., 2018). Th medium has several advantages compared t face-to-face therapy, including increased access bility, lower costs, and shorter waiting lis (Andersson et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2023). ICB has been found to be highly efficacious in treatin SAD, and has been found to be as effective as fac to-face CBT for SAD (see Guo et al., 2021, for meta-analysis). Finally, the benefits of ICBT f SAD were found to be stable and were maintaine up to a year following treatment (Guo et al 2021).
the therapeutic alliance
One of the most consistent predictors of treatme outcome in psychotherapy is the therapeutic all ance (Horvath, 2001). The therapeutic alliance defined as the quality of the collaborative relatio ship between client and therapist. The therapeuti alliance includes emotional aspects such as th trust, caring, liking, and respect between clie and therapist, as well as cognitive aspects such mutual agreement on the goals of therapy an the means that would help reach those goa (Horvath, 2001). A strong therapeutic alliance one in which clients and therapists respect eac other, work well with one another, like on another, and have a shared vision of treatme goals and the interventions needed to achieve thes goals. The research literature on the therapeuti alliance is vast. For instance, in a recent met analysis, the authors compiled approximatel 300 studies with 30,000 patients who receive
therapy (Flu ̈ ckiger et al., 2018). They found th the alliance was a modest but significant predict of treatment outcome such that higher levels alliance were associated with better outcom (r = 0.28; Fl  ̈uckiger et al., 2018). This was foun across treatments, settings, countries, and med ums of treatment delivery (e.g., face-to-fac phone, and internet-delivered; Fl  ̈uckiger et al 2018). The relationship between alliance and outcom has also been established in CBT specifically. F instance, in their meta-analysis, Flu ̈ ckiger et a (2018) reported that the alliance significantly pr dicted outcome in studies of CBT (n = 72) and th magnitude of the association was not significantl different from the magnitude found for other the apies. The relationship between alliance and ou come was also found in internet-delivere treatments. Specifically, although earlier revie found mixed results (Berger, 2017) or reporte findings based on a very small number of studi (Pihlaja et al., 2018), more recent meta-analys based on larger samples have found that the the apeutic alliance significantly predicts treatme outcome in internet interventions (see Kais et al., 2021 for a meta-analysis). The literature on the alliance during treatmen for SAD has been limited and somewhat mixe Specifically, earlier studies did not find a alliance-outcome relationship (Andersson et al 2012; M  ̈ortberg, 2014; Woody & Adessk 2002), but more recent ones with larger sampl sizes (e.g., n = 267 inAltmann et al., 2020) fou significant alliance-outcome relationshi (Altmann et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2023; Hau et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2021; Kivity et al., 2021 Only three studies have examined the therape tic alliance in ICBT for SAD. Andersson et a (2012) reported that the therapeutic alliance i their ICBT was high but did not significantly pr dict treatment outcome. Lindegaard et al. (202 examined both psychodynamic and cognitiv behavior internet-delivered treatments for SA They found that when analyzing the treatmen together, the therapeutic alliance measured at Se sion 3 significantly predicted outcome. Impo tantly, the sample in this study was small an included only 13 participants who received ICB Finally, Clark et al. (2023) found that the ther peutic alliance in their ICBT for SAD (measure after Session 2) predicted treatment outcome i internet-delivered treatment for SAD. Thus, stu ies on alliance in ICBT for SAD are scarce, an findings are mixed.

isentangling within and between
omponents
ecently, researchers have suggested that separatg the variance in psychological constructs into ithin and between variances may shed light on omplex relationships that are obscured when e total variance is examined (Zilcha-Mano, 017). For instance, within-individual avoidance nd anxiety have a negative relationship between em (if I avoid a certain anxiety-provoking situaon, my anxiety immediately drops). However, etween-individual avoidance and anxiety have a ositive relationship between them (individuals ho generally avoid an anxiety-provoking situaon experience more anxiety of that situation ompared to others who have lower levels of voidance). Thus, examining within and between ariances may help identify more nuanced associaons as well as processes occurring in opposite irections. Specifically in the context of the theraeutic alliance, separating the total variance in allince into within and between components may elp elucidate the alliance-social anxiety relationip and could potentially explain some of the ixed findings in the literature. Only a single study has examined within and etween components of the therapeutic alliance treatment for SAD (Kivity et al., 2021). Imporntly, Kivity et al. (2021) examined withindividual alliance throughout the course of treatent, but examined between-individual variance nly in early alliance (defined as the alliance in e first 3 sessions). In that study, both within nd between components were found to signifiantly predict outcome in face-to-face CBT, but ot in attention bias modification (which relies n computer-delivered interventions without subantial therapist contact). Kivity et al. (2021) sugested that due to the limited role that therapists lay in attention bias modification and the larger le of technology in that treatment, alliance did ot predict outcome as it did in CBT.
aps in the literature
he literature on the therapeutic alliance in ICBT r SAD has a number of significant gaps. First, nly three studies have examined the therapeutic lliance in ICBT for SAD (Andersson et al., 012; Clark et al., 2023; Lindegaard et al., 020). Thus, additional studies are needed to nhance our understanding of the alliance in ICBT r SAD. Second, recent advances in our underanding of the therapeutic alliance indicate that parating the alliance into within and between omponents may be important for creating a uanced and multifaceted picture of this construct.
owever, only a single study has utilized this disnction in SAD, and that study focused on face-toce CBT and attention bias modification for SAD ivity et al., 2021). No previous study has examed within and between components of the allince in ICBT for SAD. Examining ICBT is xtremely important as this treatment modality is ecoming increasingly used, and due to unique feares of ICBT that can affect the alliance, such as lying on text-based communication, not having ssions, and being able to engage the treatment om home. Third, all previous studies on the allince in ICBT for SAD have used a single measureent of the therapeutic alliance at the beginning of eatment. However, repeated measurements of e alliance can help us understand temporal proesses occurring during treatment.
he present study
he present study was designed to address these aps. We examined a large (n = 182) and recent ndomized controlled trial of ICBT for SAD CT03709615) that was found to be highly ffective in reducing symptoms of SAD (pre-post ohen’s d = 1.63; Shalom et al., 2024). We ssessed alliance and symptoms weekly during e treatment and examined both total alliance ithout disentangling within and between comonents) as well as separate within and between omponents of the alliance. We hypothesized that creases in the therapeutic alliance would predict bsequent reductions in social anxiety symptoms. his is based on the large literature that found allince to predict outcomes in psychotherapy l  ̈uckiger et al., 2018) as well as a recent study f ICBT for SAD that found a significant lliance-outcome association (Clark et al., 2023). e also explored whether within and between omponents of the alliance (separately) predict cial anxiety symptoms during ICBT for SAD ithout an explicit hypothesis. This is because nly a single study examined these components nd their relationship to social anxiety symptoms ivity et al., 2021). Moreover, Kivity et al. 021) examined face-to-face CBT and it is not lear whether the findings extend to ICBT.
Method
articipants
articipants included 182 adults who participated a preregistered randomized controlled trial of ternet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for SAD (ClinialTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03709615). All parcipants were diagnosed with primary SAD ccording to DSM-5 criteria (American

Psychiatric Association, 2013) and inter-rat agreement for a diagnosis of SAD in our lab h been found to be high (j = .86; Shalom et al 2020). Exclusion criteria included (a) high leve of suicidal ideation, (b) past or current psychoti episodes, (c) current substance use disorders, ( concurrent psychological treatment, (e) chang to pharmacological treatment in the 3 mont before the study, or during the study. Some parti ipants had comorbid diagnoses in addition to pr mary SAD, and specifically major depressiv disorder (n = 54, 29.7%), generalized anxiety di order (n = 25, 13.7%), panic disorder (n = 1 7.1%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 2.2%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 2.2%).
procedure
An online research web page was used to recru participants. The study was advertised on soci media sites relevant to SAD, such as SAD forum and SAD-related Facebook pages, as well as i public and private mental health clinics. The in tial screening was conducted online through th web page, and included the Mini-SPIN (Conn et al., 2001), a 3-item self-administered screenin tool derived from the Social Phobia Inventor (Connor et al., 2000). Participants who receive high scores underwent an additional phon screening, and those who were found eligibl were invited to the social anxiety research lab the University of Haifa. In the lab, participan completed self-report measures as well as a dia nostic assessment: the Anxiety and Related Diso ders Interview Schedule for DSM–5 (ADI Brown & Barlow, 2014). The interviews wer conducted by licensed psychologists and graduat clinical psychology students trained in the admi istration of the ADIS. The interviews were vide taped and supervised by a senior licensed clinic psychologist. Participants who received a primar diagnosis of SAD and met inclusion criteri signed an informed consent form and began th study. Participants were randomized to either trea ment (ICBT for 11 weeks) or waitlist (for 1 weeks). Importantly, all participants randomize to the waitlist condition received ICBT followin the waitlist period. A flow chart is provided i the supplementary materials. As the groups (imm diate ICBT vs. waitlist/delayed ICBT) did not si nificantly differ in their outcome or allianc during ICBT, we analyzed data from the ICB phase for all participants together.
treatment
The ICBT in the present study was based on the pr tocol of Andersson et al. (2006), which has ampl empirical support (see Kampmann et al., 2016, f a meta-analysis). The treatment consisted of 8 trea ment modules corresponding to common CBT inte ventions (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitiv restructuring, attention allocation, exposur relapse prevention) that were administered ov the course of 11 weeks. Each module included te that could be accessed via the treatment’s intern platform as well as a task related to the modul For instance, the first exposure module (choosin and planning exposures) included explanations o the rationale behind exposure, the importance choosing exposures that one thinks are difficu and challenging yet are possible and achievabl and the importance of planning exposures and defi ing success in terms of one’s own actions (rather tha others’ responses or the anxiety experienced which are both out of participants’ control). In th first exposure module, participants’ task (or hom work assignment) was to upload a plan for an exp sure using an exposure-planning form. Each week during the treatment, therapists in tiated correspondence with patients to discuss pr gress and/or difficulties, give encouragement an provide feedback on treatment tasks (i.e., th homework assignments). For instance, therapis could comment on the participants’ exposure an suggest changes if the exposure seemed too dif cult or unfeasible, or if it was not properly define (“I’ll give the presentation and I won’t get a singl word wrong. Everyone will say the presentatio was wonderful.”). After therapists’ correspo dence, participants could change their uploade materials and respond to therapists by text. Th resulted in a text-based discussion around modul content. Once the task/homework was complete and discussed, therapists opened the next modul (in the case of exposure planning, the followin module was focused on the processing of co pleted exposures). Thus, the treatment include the components of CBT using text and correspo dence with the therapist, but without live session Each week, participants completed the SPI which served as the weekly in-therapy measur ment. Therapists were graduate students in clinic psychology who received training in administerin the ICBT program prior to the study. An exper enced clinical psychologist with over 15 years experience in diagnosing and treating SAD (th corresponding author) trained therapists as we as provided ongoing supervision throughout th course of the study.

easures
o assess weekly therapeutic alliance, we used the vised Working Alliance Inventory–Short version AI-SR; Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006) adapted for ternet-based therapies (Andersson et al., 2012). he WAI-SR includes 12 items rated by patients n a 1 to 5 scale, and has three subscales: bond, oals, and task. The WAI-SR has been found to ave high reliability and internal consistency atcher & Gillaspy, 2006). In the present study, ternal consistency was high (Cronbach’s = 0.94) To assess weekly levels of social anxiety sympms, we used the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; onnor et al., 2000). The SPIN is composed of 17 ems scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (not at all) to 4 (extremely). It was found to have ood test-retest reliability and internal consistency ntony et al., 2006; Connor et al., 2000; adomsky et al., 2006) as well as to be sensitive treatment change (Antony et al., 2006). In the resent study, internal consistency was high ronbach’s a = 0.85). To assess our primary treatment outcome (i.e., re-post differences in social anxiety), we used e self-report version of the Liebowitz Social nxiety Scale (LSAS–SR; Baker et al., 2002). The SAS-SR describes 24 types of social interactions nd performance situations and participants rate e degree to which they fear and avoid these situtions on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, 3 = severe; = never, 3 = usually; for fear and avoidance spectively). The LSAS-SR was found to have igh internal consistency, to correlate highly with ther measures of social anxiety, and to be sensi
ve to treatment change (Baker et al., 2002).1 In e present study, internal consistency was high ronbach’s a = 0.92).
nalytic strategy
o examine the temporal relationship between lliance and symptoms along the course of ICBT e used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). This because the temporal data created a multilevel ructure with repeated measures (Level 1 units) ested within individuals (Level 2 units). To disenngle within and between components of the therpeutic alliance, we followed the guidelines of amaker and Muthe ́n (2020) and centered allince ratings around the average for each individ
al (creating a level-1 within component) while e average levels of each individual formed a level between component. Importantly, these within nd between components are completely indepenent (Hamaker & Muthe ́n, 2020). Missing data 46 measurements; 7.3%) were not imputed as LM can handle missing data effectively without e need for imputation (Raudenbush, 2001). oreover, imputation might have resulted in an rtificial inflation of the alliance-social anxiety link s it uses existing data to impute missing data. hus, we based analyses on all existing data oints. Additional information on missing data an be found in the supplementary materials.
1 We used the LSAS for pre and post measurements, and the IN for weekly measurements, because the SPIN is shorter and e wanted to reduce participant burden as well as increase the uality of responses (participants faced with long and repetitive easures may “disengage” and complete measures less accurately).
Results
ample characteristics
ur sample included 182 participants who sought nd received ICBT for SAD: 84 men (46.2%) and 8 women (53.8%). Participants’ mean age was 1.5 (SD = 8.9). Of the total sample, 43.2% of articipants were single, 19.8% were in a relationip, 32.4% were married, and 4.5% were ivorced. Moreover, 23.9% were high school raduates, 58.7% had a bachelor’s degree, 6.5% had a master’s degree, and 0.9% had a h.D. Participants’ mean LSAS scores at pretreatent were 81.88 (SD = 20.23). Levels of social nxiety and therapeutic alliance along the course f ICBT are presented in Table 1.
he relationship between (total

ymptoms
o examine whether total (i.e., within + between) erapeutic alliance prospectively predicted social nxiety symptoms, we estimated a multilevel odel. The independent variables were total social nxiety symptoms at time t and total therapeutic lliance at time t, and the dependent variable as total social anxiety symptoms at time t+1. hus, we examined whether the therapeutic allince in a given session predicted social anxiety mptoms in the following session, above and eyond social anxiety symptoms on a given seson. All variables were continuous Level-1 ariables. We found that social anxiety symptoms at time significantly predicted social anxiety symptoms at me t+1 (B = 0.935, SE = 0.010, t(1458) = 94.37, < .001, 95% CI = 0.915 to 0.954). Specifically, e association was positive, suggesting that higher vels of social anxiety symptoms at time t were ssociated with higher levels of social anxiety mptoms at time t+1.

apeutic alliance at time t significantly predicte social anxiety symptoms at time t+ (B = 0.038, SE = 0.011, t(1458) = 3.38 p = .001, 95% CI = 0.060 to -0.016). The assoc ation was negative, suggesting that higher levels the therapeutic alliance at time t were associate with lower levels of social anxiety symptoms time t+1. Thus, when considering the total var ance (within + between), the therapeutic allianc prospectively predicted social anxiety sympto above and beyond previous social anxiety sym toms along the course of ICBT for SAD. This consistent with our hypothesis.
2 We did not enter between-individual social anxiety as a additional independent variable as it is by definition independe of within-individual social anxiety.
predicting within-individual social
anxiety from within-individual and
between-individual alliance
To examine whether within-individual an between-individual measures of alliance predi within-individual social anxiety symptoms, w estimated a multilevel model. The independe variables were as follows: within-individual soci anxiety symptoms at time t, within-individu therapeutic alliance at time t, and betwee individual therapeutic alliance. The depende variable was within-individual social anxiet
symptoms at time t+12. Thus, we examine whether within and between alliance predicte subsequent social anxiety above and beyond prev ous social anxiety. All variables were continuo Level-1 variables, except between-individual the apeutic alliance, which was a continuous Levelvariable (the average alliance across a measurements). We found that within-individual social anxiet symptoms at time t significantly predicted withi individual social anxiety symptoms at time t+ (B = 0.770, SE = 0.018, t(1457) = 43.773, p < .00 95% CI = 0.736 to 0.805). The association w positive such that higher levels of withi individual social anxiety symptoms at time t wer associated with higher levels of within-individu social anxiety symptoms at time t+1. We als found that within-individual therapeutic allianc at time t significantly predicted within-individu social anxiety symptoms at time t+ (B = 0.060, SE = 0.021, t(1457) = 2.91 p = .004, 95% CI = 0.101 to 0.020). This ass ciation was negative such that higher levels of th therapeutic alliance at time t were associated wit lower levels of social anxiety symptoms at time +1. Thus, within-individual alliance predicted su

quent within-individual social anxiety symptoms bove and beyond previous within-individual cial anxiety symptoms. Finally, we found that etween-individual therapeutic alliance did not gnificantly predict within-individual social nxiety symptoms at time t+1 (B = 0.028, E = 0.017, t(1457) = 1.69, p = .091, 95% I = 0.061 to 0.005). In sum, these findings suggest that withindividual therapeutic alliance predicted subseuent within-individual social anxiety symptoms bove and beyond previous within-individual cial anxiety, but between-individual therapeutic lliance did not.
redicting between-individual social
nxiety from within-individual and
etween-individual alliance
the previous section, we examined whether ithin- and between-individual alliance predicted ithin-individual social anxiety. In this analysis, e examined whether within- and betweendividual alliance predicted between-individual cial anxiety. The independent variables were ithin-individual and between-individual theraeutic alliance, and the dependent variable was etween-individual social anxiety symptoms. ithin-individual alliance was a continuous evel-1 variable, and between-individual alliance nd social anxiety were continuous Level-2 varibles (the average alliance across all measurements nd the average social anxiety across all measureents respectively). We found that within-individual alliance was not gnificantly associated with between-individual cial anxiety symptoms (B = 0.012, SE = 0.037, 130.53) = 0.324, p = .746, 95% CI = 0.061 to .084), but between-individual alliance was gnificantly associated with between-individual cial anxiety symptoms (B = 0.115, SE = 0.031, 1604.99) = 3.668, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.054 to .177). Importantly, this association was positive ch that higher average levels of therapeutic allince across all measurements were associated with igher average levels of social anxiety across all easurements. In sum, the association between withindividual alliance and within-individual social nxiety (reported in the previous section) was negtive, whereas the association between betweendividual alliance and between-individual social nxiety (reported in this section) was positive.
dditional analyses
e also examined whether between- and withindividual social anxiety symptoms predicted
ithin- and between-individual therapeutic lliance. These analyses are reported in the pplementary materials. We found that withindividual social anxiety symptoms measured in a iven session did not significantly predict withindividual therapeutic alliance in the following ssion.
Discussion
the present study we examined whether the erapeutic alliance is associated with symptoms f social anxiety along the course of internetelivered CBT for SAD. We examined data from large treatment trial (n = 182) in which individuls with SAD reported on their social anxiety and lliance with the therapist each week during the eatment (for 11 weeks). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that hen examining total variances (within + etween), therapeutic alliance predicted subseuent social anxiety. This is in line with previous udies that have found a significant alliance–social nxiety relationship during treatment for SAD hen examining total variances (Altmann et al., 020; Haug et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2021; ivity et al., 2021), including two studies on ternet-delivered treatment (Clark et al., 2023; indegaard et al., 2020). However, other studies ave not found such a relationship (Andersson t al., 2012; Mo ̈ rtberg, 2014; Woody & dessky, 2002). Thus, our findings are in line with me previous findings but not others due to the ixed and inconsistent literature. A number of asons for these divergent findings can be considred. First, the alliance-outcome relationship in eneral and the alliance–social anxiety relationship ore specifically may be small in magnitude and erefore may not be found in small samples due low statistical power. Along these lines, our udy as well as other studies that found an allince–social anxiety relationship examined relavely large samples (e.g., n = 182 in the present udy; n = 267 in Altmann et al., 2020). In addion, different analytic choices and statistical analses may have also contributed to these divergent ndings (see supplementary materials for an xtended discussion of this). Finally, another otential explanation for the mixed findings in e literature is that examining total variances (as pposed to analyzing within and between compoents separately) may obscure different psychologal process that operate in opposite directions. his is examined in our exploratory analyses. We explored within and between components of e alliance and their effects on social anxiety. We und that the within component of the therapeutic

alliance predicted subsequent within-individu social anxiety but the between component di not. Put differently, our findings indicate that individuals reported higher alliance during a give week (compared to their own average), their soci anxiety in the following week significantl decreased (compared to their own average). Th finding is consistent with Kivity et al. (2021 who found that within-individual therapeutic all ance predicted subsequent change in social anxiet symptoms. Importantly, we also found that th between component of the therapeutic allianc was associated with between-individual social an iety but the within component was not. Interes ingly, the direction of this association w positive, such that individuals with higher leve of social anxiety across all measurements (co pared to others) also had higher levels of the ther peutic alliance across all measurements (compare to others). One potential explanation for the positiv between-individual association is that individua with higher social anxiety are more fearful others’ negative reactions and rejection (e.g Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2021) and therefor make an extra effort to create positive relatio ships with others. Put differently, the more sociall anxious one is, the more agreeable one can becom in order to reduce the probability of rejection, an this can lead to elevated alliance with the therapi as well. Consistently, levels of the therapeutic all ance in the present study were high, and high than those reported for individuals with maj depressive disorder and generalized anxiety diso der in previous studies (e.g., Andersson et al 2012). Another potential explanation is that ind viduals higher on social anxiety tend to rate th therapeutic alliance as higher due to social desi ability (Holden & Passey, 2009). In other word due to their social concerns, individuals wit SAD may have a strong desire to portray relatio ships with others (and specifically with the ther pist) as more aligned or better than they ar This can also potentially explain the positive ass ciation between alliance and social anxiety whe examining between-individual variance. One potential explanation for the negativ within-individual association is that week-b week increases in the alliance during therap may indicate that clients with SAD are becomin more aligned with their therapists in terms of goa and tasks. For instance, an important therapeuti intervention in ICBT is exposure and when clien become increasingly convinced that exposures wi help them (thus increasing their agreement wit
the therapist on tasks), they are more likely to co duct the exposure and experience a subseque reduction in social anxiety. In other words, durin treatment, increases in alliance from week to wee may indicate a growing alignment of goals an tasks, and this can lead to reductions in client social anxiety. Our findings on the positive associatio between between-individual alliance an between-individual social anxiety may seem odds with the findings of Kivity et al. (2021 who found negative between-individual associ tions between early alliance and social anxiet However, important methodological differenc may explain the apparent discrepancy. First, w examined the entire between-individual varianc in alliance using the average across all measur ments (Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022), where Kivity et al. (2021) examined between-individu variance in early alliance (the average alliance i the first three sessions). Second, we examined th entire between-individual variance in social anx ety as the average across all measurement whereas Kivity et al. (2021) examined the varianc in social anxiety following the early sessions (i.e Session 4 and beyond). Thus, Kivity et al. (202 examined partial between-individual varianc (early between-individual variance in allianc and later between-individual variance in soci anxiety), whereas we examined the entir between-individual variance for both alliance an social anxiety. Another potential reason for the discrepancy i findings could be that Kivity et al. (2021) exa ined face-to-face CBT whereas the present stud examined ICBT. Thus, it is possible that diffe ences in treatment format (e.g., less therapist co tact in internet-delivered treatments, reliance o text-based communication in internet-delivere treatments) could have affected these finding For instance, interactions with the therapist ma be less anxiety-provoking for individuals wit SAD in ICBT than in face-to-face CBT (becaus of text-based communication in ICBT; Ore Yagoda & Aderka, 2021). Thus, when soci anxiety is low-to-moderate (as in ICBT), it ma lead to enhanced efforts to promote positive rel tions with the therapist and enhanced allianc However, when social anxiety is high (as is mor likely to be the case in CBT), it may be associate with less alliance (because individuals’ anxiety ge in the way of their pro-social efforts). This expl nation is in line with a recent study that found th individuals with SAD demonstrate a heightene effort to synchronize with others during smal

lk conversations when anxiety is low, but a duced effort to synchronize with others during timate conversations when anxiety is high sher et al., 2020). Alternatively, it is possible at the social anxiety experienced during sessions face-to-face CBT may hinder clients’ ability to nderstand and remember what therapists say. his can lead to reduced agreement on tasks and wer alliance. However, in ICBT communication text-based, and social anxiety may lead clients to heck correspondence with the therapist repeatdly, which can increase agreement on tasks and nhance alliance. Importantly, these explanations ould be regarded as speculative: much future search is needed before firm conclusions can be rawn. A number of clinical implications can be menoned. Our findings suggest that therapists should onsider working on the therapeutic alliance in rder to improve it, regardless of whether the allince is weak or strong as it is within-person provements in the alliance that are associated ith reductions in symptoms. Put differently, even hen treating clients who create a weak alliance ompared to other clients), or treating clients ho create a strong alliance (compared to other lients), working on the alliance during treatment facilitate within-individual increases can be portant and can lead to symptom reductions. orking on alliance involves initiating conversaons regarding the emotional bond between client nd therapist (do clients feel they can trust the erapist? do they feel that the therapist genuinely ares for them? do they feel that the therapist truly nderstands them?), as well as regarding agreeent on goals and tasks in therapy. Creating a eaningful discussion of these elements that leads mutually agreed-upon goals and tasks, in the ontext of a positive and supporting bond, is the oal of working on the alliance (see Muran & arber, 2011, for a review of evidence-based interentions that enhance the alliance). Our findings also suggest that when ruptures in e alliance occur, therapists should devote sources to repair the alliance even when the verall level of alliance is high, and that this can otentially prevent aggravation of symptoms arsson et al., 2018). In addition, although one ould assume that the therapeutic alliance may e not be important in ICBT, our findings suggest at this is not the case. Specifically, the therapeuc alliance may be important in ICBT, and theraists should invest resources into forging strong lliances, even when treatment is internetelivered. Finally, our findings have research plications as they suggest that separating within
nd between components of the alliance may help lucidate complex and potentially opposite psyhological processes. Our study has a number of limitations. First, we id not directly compare ICBT and face-to-face BT in our study. Thus, we can only speculate n the differences between these treatment formats nd their effects on the alliance-social anxiety relaonship. Future studies can directly compare treatent formats to examine their effects more irectly. Second, we examined only client-rated lliance and social anxiety severity. Future studies an examine therapist-rated alliance and therapistted symptoms (in addition to client-rated varibles) to contribute to a comprehensive and multiceted assessment of these constructs. This could lso be used to assess whether processes of social esirability affect clients’ ratings. Third, as our udy did not experimentally manipulate the therpeutic alliance, our conclusions cannot be treated s indicating firm causal relationships between cial anxiety and the alliance. Future studies can anipulate alliance to examine causal effects. or instance, creating two treatment conditions which work on the alliance is given differential cus (e.g., intense work on alliance, vs. minimal ork on the alliance) may help shed light on caul effects. Fourth, we examined the alliance as a nified construct, and did not separate it into indiidual components of bond, goals, and tasks. uture studies can examine these separate compoents of the alliance separately to increase our nderstanding its granularity. In sum, we examined a large sample of individals with SAD receiving ICBT. We found evidence r complex therapeutic alliance–social anxiety ssociations during treatment, such that negative ssociations exist for within components and posive associations exist for between variances. Our ndings can contribute to the literature of the therpeutic alliance in treatments for SAD and in ternet-delivered treatments, and may also have portant clinical implications for delivering BT.
