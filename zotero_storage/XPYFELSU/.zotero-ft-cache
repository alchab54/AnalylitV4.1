Abstract
IMPORTANCE Therapeutic alliance is a core component of patient- and family-centered care,
particularly in the setting of advancing cancer. Communication approaches used by pediatric
oncologists to foster therapeutic alliance with children with cancer and their families are not well
understood.
OBJECTIVES To identify key oncologist-driven facilitators associated with building and sustaining
therapeutic alliance in the setting of advancing pediatric cancer and to develop a framework to guide
clinical practice and future investigation of therapeutic alliance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this qualitative study, serial disease reevaluation
discussions that occurred in the clinic, inpatient hospital, or off campus via telephone were recorded
among pediatric oncologists, patients with high-risk cancer, and their families across 24 months or
until death, whichever occurred first, from 2016 to 2020. This analysis focused on recorded
discussions for pediatric patients who experienced progressive disease during the study period.
Content analysis was conducted across recorded dialogue to derive inductive codes and identify
themes. Participants were patient-parent dyads for whom a primary oncologist projected the
patient’s survival to be 50% or less, all family members and friends who attended any of their
recorded disease reevaluation conversations, and their oncologists and other clinicians who
attended the recorded discussions.
RESULTS A total of 33 patient-parent dyads were enrolled and followed longitudinally. From this
cohort, 17 patients experienced disease progression during the study period, most of whom were
female (11 [64.7%]) and White (15 [88.2%]) individuals. For these patients, 141 disease reevaluation
discussions were audio recorded, comprising 2400 minutes of medical dialogue. Most children (14
[82.4%]) died during the study period. A median of 7 disease reevaluation discussions per patient
(range, 1-19) were recorded. Content analysis yielded 28 unique concepts associated with
therapeutic alliance fostered by oncologist communication. Ultimately, 7 core themes emerged to
support a framework for clinician approaches associated with optimizing therapeutic alliance: human
connection, empathy, presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study, pediatric oncologists used diverse
communication approaches associated with building and deepening connections across advancing
illness. These findings offer a framework to support clinical and research strategies for strengthening
therapeutic alliance among pediatric oncologists, patients, and families.

Introduction
Patients with cancer and their families experience profound physical, psychological, and existential
suffering across the illness trajectory.1-4 Development of therapeutic alliance between the patient or
family and the oncologist may help ease the pain.5-7 Therapeutic alliance refers to the nature and
strength of an affective bond between the patient or family and the clinician in collaboration toward
shared goals.8-11 Among adult patients with advanced cancer, a strong therapeutic alliance with the
oncologist has been associated with emotional acceptance of terminal illness and decreased invasive
interventions at end of life.5 For young adults with cancer, the patient-oncologist alliance also has
been shown to be protective against suicidal ideation.12 In addition, a positive patient-oncologist
therapeutic alliance appears to benefit caregivers of adult patients with cancer across the illness
course and during bereavement; more specifically, a patient’s report of a strong therapeutic alliance
has been shown to be associated with a caregiver’s report of better social function, health-related
quality of life, and emotional well-being following the patient’s death.6
As proposed by the National Cancer Institute13 and further validated in pediatric cancer,14
relationship building is considered one of the core functions of patient-centered communication.15
Most parents of children with cancer form trusting relationships with their child’s oncologist, and
development of trust is associated with parent perception of high-quality physician
communication.16 Fostering therapeutic alliance through patient-centered communication is
particularly critical in the context of cancer relapse or progression, when children and families
navigate stressful decisions.17 Unfortunately, poor outcomes have been shown to threaten
therapeutic alliance, with parents reporting decreased trust in oncologists in the setting of
advancing disease.16
Although high-quality oncologist communication is known to be important for therapeutic
alliance,16 specific communication approaches used by oncologists to facilitate therapeutic alliance
in pediatric cancer are not well understood. The U-CHAT (Understanding Communication in
Healthcare to Achieve Trust) trial was designed to better understand the evolution and impact of
communication across the advancing pediatric cancer trajectory.18 In this prospective, longitudinal
study, serial disease reevaluation conversations among pediatric oncologists, patients with high-risk
cancer, and their families were audio recorded across the illness course to the time of death. The
primary aim of this study was to characterize the evolution of communication strategies used by
pediatric oncologists across advancing illness. In this article, we present the findings from a
secondary aim of that study: to identify and describe oncologist approaches for promoting
therapeutic alliance, with the goal of developing a framework to organize emerging constructs and
better understand potential facilitators for alliance to target in future research.
Methods
The protocol for this qualitative study was developed by an interdisciplinary team of pediatric
oncology and hospice and palliative medicine experts in collaboration with a bereaved parent
steering council; it was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at St Jude Children’s
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Data were collected between 2016 and 2020. We present
study methods and findings following the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research
(COREQ) reporting guideline and checklist.19 All participants provided written or verbal informed
consent that was obtained in a manner consistent with the Common Rule requirements. No one
received compensation or was offered any incentive for participating in this study.
Details about the study protocol and feasibility and acceptability metrics for enrollment and
capture of longitudinal data have been previously published.18,20 In brief, we enrolled a convenience
sample of 6 pediatric oncologists who provided care to patients with solid tumors at an academic
pediatric cancer center and obtained verbal informed consent. We then enrolled 4 to 6 patient
parent dyads with poor prognoses per oncologist. Eligible patients were aged 0 to 30 years,

diagnosed as having non–central nervous system solid tumors, and considered to have poor
prognosis, with the primary oncologist estimating survival of 50% or lower. Eligible parents or
guardians were legal caregivers aged 18 years or older with English language proficiency who planned
to be present for disease reevaluation discussions. Eligible patient-parent dyads were identified by
the research team through review of outpatient clinic schedules and institutional trial lists, and
permission to approach dyads was requested from the primary oncologist. A research team member
obtained written informed consent from patients and caregivers during a clinic visit that did not
include a disease reevaluation discussion; patients aged 12 years or older provided formal assent, and
patients aged 18 years or older and parents provided consent. Demographic and disease-related
information were extracted from the electronic medical record.
Patient-parent dyads were followed prospectively, with serial disease reevaluation discussions
among patients, their family members and friends, and oncologists and other clinicians recorded in
the clinic, hospital, or off campus via telephone across the illness course until death or 24 months
from disease progression on study, whichever occurred first. The present work focuses on analysis of
recorded discussions for dyads who experienced progressive disease during the study period.
To characterize key components of therapeutic alliance building in advancing pediatric cancer,
we performed content analysis of recorded medical dialogue. We wanted to approach the data with
openness to allow the dialogue to inform the findings; however, we also started with a priori
constraints that shaped the lens through which we assessed the data (ie, we wanted to focus on
clinician behaviors that served as potential facilitators of therapeutic alliance), precluding use of a
traditional grounded theory approach. A research team representing medical and nursing
perspectives across pediatric oncology and palliative medicine (Table 1) reviewed the literature
related to therapeutic alliance in oncology; finding little consensus for fundamentals of alliance
building in pediatric cancer care, we used an inductive approach21 to identify oncologist
communication approaches to foster affective bonds with patients and families. Two researchers
(E.C.K. and S.R.) repetitively listened to audio recordings, conducted extensive memo writing, and
used raw data to inform development of codes, code definitions, and salient examples related to
therapeutic alliance building.22 Additional researchers (C.W. and J.N.B.) reviewed recorded content
and provided feedback in iterative cycles of codebook development. As facilitators were identified,
we reviewed existing frameworks when possible to help codify concepts. For example, for
expressions of empathy, we referenced the naming, understanding, respecting, supporting, and
exploring framework for navigating emotions.23,24 However, through the processes of memo writing
and inductive code development, we created definitions for each code based on the concepts

emerging from the dialogue. The codebook was finalized following deep review of sufficient raw data
to reach saturation, with no new therapeutic alliance concepts emerging from the recorded dialogue.
The codebook is presented in Table 2.
Data Analysis
Coding processes were conducted within MAXQDA, a mixed-methods data analysis software
system.25 Three analysts (E.C.K., S.R., and C.W.) pilot tested the codebook across a series of medical
dialogue recordings to identify areas of variance. All analysts met to reconcile variances and achieve
consensus, modifying the codebook as needed to improve dependability, confirmability, and
credibility of independent codes.26 Following codebook finalization, independent coding was
performed by 2 analysts (S.R. and C.W.), with weekly meetings to review any coding variances and
third-party (E.C.K. and J.N.B.) adjudication to reach consensus. Consistency in code segmentation
also was reviewed to ensure a standardized approach (E.C.K., S.R., and C.W.). Code frequency,
temporal duration, and distribution across discussion subtype were calculated and reported as
descriptive statistics. Codes with greater frequency and impactful content were examined more
closely, with further inductive exploration, categorization, and synthesis of identified quotes to
generate themes (E.C.K., M.E.L., J.N.B., and J.W.M.). Identified themes were then incorporated into
a summary figure, with input from all authors and iterative revision, to ensure that themes were
appropriately integrated.
Results
In total, 33 patient-parent dyads were enrolled and followed longitudinally. From this cohort, 17
patient-parent dyads, representing all 6 participating oncologists, experienced advancing disease
during the study period. Most patients were female (11 [64.7%]) and White (15 [88.2%]) individuals;
additional participant demographic variables are presented in Table 3. In total, 141 disease
reevaluation conversations were audio recorded, comprising approximately 2400 minutes of
recorded dialogue. A median of 7 medical discussions per patient (range, 1-19) were recorded. Most
patients (14 [82.4%]) died during the study period; 3 remained alive at 24 months. No participants
formally dropped out of the study, although 1 dyad received care at another institution prior to death.
Data on patient-parent dyads who declined enrollment in the larger study have been published
previously.20 In brief, 7 of 41 approached dyads (17%) did not enroll owing to hesitation or refusal by
either the patient (n = 4) or parent (n = 4). Although these numbers are small, refusal rates did not
appear to disproportionately exclude dyads based on race and ethnicity. Only 1 of the 7 dyads self
identified as Black (approximately 14%) and 1 as Hispanic (approximately 14%), which are roughly
equivalent to the percentages of Black patients and Hispanic patients treated at the institution.
Across the advancing illness course, we identified 28 unique concepts as potential facilitators
associated with therapeutic alliance, with further synthesis generating 7 core themes: human
connection, empathy, presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty (Table 4). We present
these themes as a framework for potential facilitators associated with therapeutic alliance in
pediatric cancer (Figure).
Human Connection
Oncologists promoted connection on a human level with the patient and family through 4
approaches. In the remembering approach, oncologists recalled information, unprompted, related to
the patient’s or family’s personal life. Some recollections were lighthearted or fun (“Where is my
birthday twin?”); other times, oncologists recalled prior feelings central to the patient’s values related
to decision-making (“I know that in the past, you’ve also said it’s very hard to be away from family.”).
Through sharing, oncologists also contributed personal information about themselves or their lives
as an approach to find common ground with the patient or family. Shared information ranged from
minor details about their personality or likes or dislikes (eg, “I’m not a reptile person.”) to a window

into their personal life or emotions (eg, “I don’t know about you guys, but the uncertainty drives me
crazy.”). Oncologists used friendly conversation or small talk unrelated to the illness or treatment plan
to connect with patients and families. Finally, affection or expressions of fondness were also used to
help generate connection on a human level: “It’s okay if you don’t want to, sweetheart.”
Empathy
We identified 7 facilitators of empathy, including 2 de novo concepts and 5 concepts originating from
naming, understanding, respecting, supporting, and exploring, each of which was refined during the
inductive coding process. In the first de novo concept, standing in another’s shoes, oncologists used
empathetic statements to convey a willingness to imagine the patient’s or family’s struggle: “You
guys are so wonderful. And I can only imagine how hard this is too because you’ve lost a lot of
friends.” In the second de novo concept, saying sorry, oncologists used “I’m sorry” statements as a

[Patient: It’s beating so fast that it’s, like, making me feel bad, and my stomach is like ...] You’re anxious. • You just look a little overwhelmed. • You looked awfully worried when I walked in the door. Is that what was, is that what you were thinking we’d be talking about today? [Patient: Yeah.] You did. You had a feeling.

Code Example
Accommodating • [Patient: Do you know when we can leave?] Today. [Patient: ‘Cause I was invited to go to something.] Go. What are you doing here? I can always give you a call, right, with the results.... It’s not like you have to be here for me to tell you it looks like this, so go. • Wednesday would be the best, right, because then your last day would be Christmas eve. You could have Christmas without having to go to the hospital, and then you guys could hit the air. • I assume you want to get your chemo done before Thanksgiving? So we could start it tomorrow night in the Medicine room and try to move it up so that by Tuesday we’re done. Inclusivity
Open door • There’s not a wrong answer for you at this point in terms of whether you want to do something that you feel is more aggressive or whether you want to do something that is taking a step back and focusing a little bit more on, you know, allowing you to do something that gives you some treatment without significantly impacting your quality of life and your ability to do things that you want to do. • There are some other things that we can try.... You know, they are available. They are at your disposal, and I’m willing to pursue those things as long as they are things that you want to do and if we feel that it gives us any opportunity to have some benefit.
Affirming • We should use the morphine. If you think that’s what’s best for her. • So, it’s a matter of what your goals are for him. In terms of treatment and treatment effects in what you ... how you want him to spend the time that he has here with us. • I wanted to present you the 3, all 3 options and get a sense of what you felt like, what you felt like was important for you right now and how you perceive all 3 of them.
Connecting symptoms
• The biggest one is this one, which is why she complains here. But this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one, and you said that sometimes she complains of pain here, that’s exactly where it is. • I think it likely is from one of the, from that area over here, cause I think, just based on the location that you’re reporting, it looks fairly consistent with that region. • There’s also some uptake that’s up in the skull base. Umm, and you know, it’s possible that could be contributing to some of the headaches that you’re having because you’re saying that they’re starting at the back of your head.
Using analogy • It’s kind of smushing on. So if this is your—may I borrow your tape? Okay perfect, great. So if this—here look. This is your back bone and then in the middle you have a spinal cord. Okay, so this is your vertebral bodies bones kind of surround your spinal cord, right? We need them to because they protect it. So the tumor that’s growing—we use it with this green tape—it’s kind of growing in this area, and some of it is growing outside of the bone, from the bone and then a little bit is kind of pushing, it’s like kissing the spinal cord. • That thing hasn’t really changed in size either, it’s just stayed this big. It’s like the sun ... just like this circular thing right there. So that hasn’t changed. • So there’s a switch, just to put it simply. When tumor cells turn on that switch, T cells don’t recognize these tumor cells. What all of these drugs do is they basically turn that switch off so that T cells can recognize tumor cells and kill them.
Showing images • So let me pull this up, ‘cause it—a picture—I think makes it much easier to see. • So on what we’re seeing is, you can see some changes in the areas that we radiated. For one, these 2 are pretty much almost gone, if not completely gone.... So those 2 lesions on the sides had a nice response. • So they’re just, they’re 2, and we can, we can pull up the images if you’d like to see what we’re talking about. There’s just these 2. They’re in the back of the upper right lung. Humor
Comedy (making jokes)
• You know the ankle you just treat with RICE. You know that acronym, right? Rest, ice, compression, elevation.... No, not like eating rice. You’re like, “white or brown?” [Parent: Yeah, we eat lots of rice.] I can already hear you now, like sending an email later: we’ve been eating lots of rice but his ankle still hurts! • [Parent: Either that or get somebody from the Medellin cartel to bring it down up.] I don’t know which cartels are active these days.... Honestly, you know, ever since that guy, what’s his name? The guy that finally got caught.... Yeah, El Chapo, I mean, I mean if El Chapo’s not gonna do it, I don’t know who’s gonna get the drug to you. • You could tweet it to us. If you could fit it into 140 characters.
Ribbing (gentle mocking)
• I’m sorry, every time I look at those pants, it looks like you have [a] beer cozy on your leg. • But it sounds like it’s not bugging you. Unless you’re not fessing up. Cough it up, dude.
Matching maturity level
• Right, are you still mad at me? Okay, that’s okay. Everybody gets mad at me. I don’t mind. [Patient: It’s okay.] It’s okay. Alright, you forgive me? [Patient: No, no, I was just saying it’s okay.] Oh, okay, so you don’t forgive me. You just saying it’s okay. Gotcha, alright. • I know. You’re like, he never probably thought we would be like, come on [patient], we need you to poop! • You did it big boy. Thank you. You’re sooo good ... Yayyyyy, woohooo! Up here, you wanna come play, come play. Honesty
Warning shot • Alright, well unfortunately there’s no good way to tell you this. • So, I do not have good news. • So scans, we got, we got a spot we gotta talk about, okay?
Transparency • [Patient’s name], the bottom line from the scans that we just got is that we’re seeing evidence of progression and that we’re going to come off the study, okay? • We’ll do everything all over again and then, you know, periodically for a couple years to make sure. because it still could come back.... As best we know, if 1 cell escapes all this, it eventually comes back, and that’s the scary part. • I worry that, because of all these people here, you’re worried more about them than [about] you. Are you?

mechanism of conveying empathy: “I’m so sorry . . . that’s not what we wanted to talk to you about
today.”
Oncologists also used naming to identify emotions that presented during discussion, such as
fear, sadness, or anxiety. By labeling the reaction or feeling (eg, “You just got the most nervous look
on your face” or “The tears are worries, I got it; it could be [disease]”), oncologists showed an ability
to recognize the feelings of the patient or family. Oncologists also expressed understanding by
acknowledging or appreciating the patient’s and family’s difficult situation and validating their
emotions. At times, oncologists (or clinicians) repeated statements as a form of affirmation: [Patient:
“That’s a lot of information.”] “It is a lot of information.” Oncologists showed respect through
provision of encouragement, praise, or reassurance: “You did everything right.” Respect often
overlapped with the concept of supporting, in which oncologists expressed concern alongside a
willingness to help: “As long as you want to try something, we’re willing to try something.”
Oncologists also cultivated empathy through the concept of exploring, in which they offered patients
or family members an opportunity to talk about whatever they were feeling or processing: “What do
you want to, what’s running through your head?”
Presence
We found 2 concepts that promoted a sense of meaningful presence as part of nurturing therapeutic
alliance: being in the moment and silence. Oncologists verbalized with intention their willingness to
stay in the moment, whether by giving time (eg, “We need to take the time. I think you guys deserve
the time”) or by silencing other distractions (eg, “I turned my ringer off”). Silence was also used with
intention to create space for processing and emotional connection.
Partnering
We discerned 3 concepts that fostered a sense of partnership among oncologists, patients, and their
families. In the concept of nonabandonment, oncologists expressed a commitment to stay, no matter
how difficult things became: “You know that you will never shake us, like good luck trying.” This
concept of being “in it for the long run” also manifested through running imagery: “We love you, and
we’re going, we’re all going to do this together, okay. This is a marathon and we’re all going to just
keep running.” In the concept of team mentality, oncologists used “we” language to demonstrate a
sense of teamwork and collaboration with respect to values, goals, or decision-making: “This is not a
conversation that says that we don’t keep fighting because we always keep fighting.” Finally, in the
concept of accommodation, oncologists partnered with patients and families by anticipating and
meeting their needs and preferences. For example, the oncologists offered to reschedule visits or
therapies to optimize quality of life: “I think we can do [the treatment] in a way that’s not going to
interfere with the trips that you have planned.”
Inclusivity
We found 5 concepts that centered or included the patient or family with respect to transfer of
knowledge or navigation of decision-making. In the open door concept, oncologists used open-ended
Table 4. Therapeutic Alliance Codes and Representative Quotes (continued)
Code Example
Giving opinion • In the absence of symptoms, I don’t think that we need to do anything, so I would feel very comfortable just waiting 2 months and repeating the PET. • And you know what I’d say to that, we’re not going to do that. [Patient: That’s crazy.] ‘Cause that’s crazy. That’s a terrible idea, okay? So that one is off the table. • For me, I think that one makes sense for you because there’s some biological reasons that I think could be effective for [disease type] and because it’s at least a regimen that I think you know you’ve tolerated before.... So I feel like it’s something that could be doable for you.
Summarizing • The long and short of it is, there’s nothing that looks like cancer. • So that’s a long way of saying, yes, I’ll consider it, you know, with the caveat of that we gotta get to a state where we feel it’s even worth your time. • And so to me that means that the tumor cells are dying, right? They’re not as active, they’re not replicating as much and growing, and so that’s a good thing.

statements to lay groundwork for sensitive conversations and to prompt patients or families to voice
their hopes, wishes, opinions, or goals: “If that’s part of our goal . . . maybe we want to do that
without getting into really intense things that are going to get you stuck in the hospital and things like
that. You know, to me that seems like it would be a very, that would be a very reasonable goal, a good
goal to have.” Oncologists also reinforced inclusivity by affirming the voice of the patient or parent
as integral to decision-making: “Buddy, every decision that we make is the right decision for you
because they’re your decisions, you know. We’re not, you know, whatever you decide is not ever
going to be the wrong choice.”
Practically, oncologists used several concrete strategies to center the patient or family in
medical dialogue. By connecting symptoms, they linked imaging findings with how a patient felt,
translating abstract data into meaningful patient-centered information: “The biggest issues are in
your bones. I think that’s why you feel bad.” By using analogies, oncologists simplified medical
information into lay language for patients and families: “Your bone can look a little bit more like Swiss
cheese, to use an analogy, and then the trouble with Swiss cheese is it has holes, and so if pushing
on it having a lot of stress you can sometimes get a little bit of collapse.” Oncologists further included
patients and families by showing imaging during discussions: “All this area over here is in her right
shoulder, even though we radiated it, it’s much, much worse. All this super black stuff, that is disease.”
Humor
We identified 3 concepts related to humor as a key aspect of therapeutic alliance. In the concept of
comedy, oncologists made jokes, often at their own expense, sharing in laughter with patients and
families. Even serious conversations were sometimes punctuated by moments of levity or silliness via
verbal or physical humor or sometimes through song. In the concept of ribbing, oncologists
connected with patients or families through playful teasing: “She doesn’t have time for this. She’s got
things to do. [Parent: Bother me for 1 of them.] Mm-hmm, bother, bother [patient]. That’s top, top
of the list every day.” In the concept of matching maturity level, oncologists connected with patients

Inclusivity
Oncologists develop and deepen therapeutic alliance through 7 thematic approaches: human connection, empathy, presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty. We present a framework for conceptualizing the interconnectivity and interdependency of these core facilitators associated with therapeutic alliance in pediatric cancer. The framework aesthetic intentionally resembles a wheel, evoking the idea that therapeutic alliance helps to move communication forward more productively, enabling clinicians, patients, and families to travel collaboratively across the illness course.

by aligning their tone or language choices with the patient’s developmental stage: “I know that’s what
you’re thinking, isn’t it? Yeah, like, loser, why haven’t we talked about this before?”
Honesty
We identified 4 concepts around honesty as a strategy to engender trust. In the warning shot
concept, oncologists prefaced bad news with a forewarning to allow a patient or family to
emotionally prepare: “So I’m afraid I don’t have very good news for you. So let me start from the
beginning, okay.” In the concept of transparency, oncologists emphasized a desire to be honest or
frank, particularly when discussing difficult information: “But it doesn’t mean that we don’t have
plans. Okay, I just want to be honest.” Phrases such as “I worry” also enabled oncologists to share their
thoughts candidly. Oncologists further fostered alliance via the giving opinions concept, using
statements of ownership (eg, “I think,” “I feel,” “I recommend,” and “I believe”) when discussing illness
progression, treatment planning, or goals of care: “I think we need to continue this therapy. Whether
it’s really doing a lot or not, I don’t know, but I feel very uncomfortable stopping.” In the concept of
summarizing, oncologists synthesized challenging information, thereby strengthening its
trustworthiness: “What I would say, then, to kind of put the whole picture together, is that things are
stable.”
Discussion
Therapeutic alliance is one core component of patient- and family-centered communication,
particularly in the context of advancing illness. Through analysis of key conversations among
pediatric oncologists, patients with advancing cancer, and their families, we identified 7 themes
informing a framework for potential facilitators associated with therapeutic alliance: human
connection, empathy, presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty (Figure). This framework
has possible utility in clinical practice and future research. When striving to create, sustain, or repair
therapeutic alliance, particularly during stressful time points across an advancing illness course,
clinicians might draw from this framework to emphasize certain facilitators with intention.
Recognizing that personalities and communication styles naturally vary, clinicians may review the
framework and choose to highlight behaviors that feel most genuine to them. We studied
conversations recorded at times of crisis for patients and families, and even in these painful spaces,
we found moments wherein clinicians created meaning (even laughter) through connection and
caring. We hope that the facilitators underpinning this framework may help guide clinicians in
forming meaningful therapeutic bonds, particularly when sharing difficult information, as a way to
affirm our shared humanity and communicate to patients and families that their feelings matter.
This study also highlights the need for future investigation of several important, unexplored
questions. We observed interactions among oncologists, patients, and their families across evolving
illness, and we identified potential facilitators associated with therapeutic alliance. However, the
identified concepts reflected our perspectives as clinicians and observers. We did not ask parents
and children what they personally valued with respect to therapeutic alliance, and we do not know
whether these interactions actually supported the human bond between clinicians and children or
their families. We also do not know how cultural background or personal lived experiences may
influence oncologists’ comfort levels with using certain facilitators of relationship building. For
example, although the concept of “sharing personal information” emerged as a frequent approach,
this method may not be appropriate or valued by everyone. Similarly, the act of “giving opinions” may
come across as paternalistic by some stakeholders. The constructs that we identified, informing
development of this initial theoretical framework, require validation to determine whether they align
with what patients and families believe to be most important. Future investigation should consider
participatory research methods to engage patients and families in assessing the trustworthiness of
constructs and prioritizing communication approaches that they perceive to be most meaningful.

Although preliminary, this framework outlines key components associated with creating
therapeutic alliance, filling a gap in the literature. Few existing conceptual frameworks characterize
the variables intrinsic to development and evolution of therapeutic alliance in pediatric cancer care.
One model derived from the experience of oncologists proposes a cyclical reinforcing association
between effective communication and therapeutic alliance across the illness trajectory15; however,
that model does not propose constructs for building alliance. Several models for therapeutic alliance
in psychology and psychotherapy exist, yet their authors acknowledge ongoing challenges with
application of the models toward measurement and characterization of therapeutic alliance in
medicine.27,28
Several quantitative tools have been validated to measure therapeutic alliance between patients
and oncologists. For example, The Human Connection scale is a psychometrically validated tool with
Likert scale items that measures the extent of patient-reported mutual understanding, caring, and trust
with their physicians, which has shown reliability in adult cancer populations.5 Yet given the nuance and
complexity of therapeutic alliance, a mixed-methods approach that incorporates qualitative analysis
has potential utility. Recognizing the potential role that therapeutic alliance plays in influencing patient
care, caregiver well-being, and bereavement outcomes, studying therapeutic alliance as a potential
modifiable factor is important. This theoretical framework offers potential infrastructure to further our
understanding of therapeutic alliance in future cancer research.
Limitations
Study limitations include single-site design and potential sample bias for patient-parent dyads
inclined to value or promote therapeutic alliance; all eligible oncologists participated, mitigating
selection bias for physicians. Racial and ethnic diversity was limited and requires prioritization in
future work. Rarely, discussions were not recorded due to logistical issues or at the request of the
participating patient or parent; missing data might influence concept generation. However, given the
saturation of themes across thousands of recorded minutes, several missing time points are less
likely to influence the synthesis of findings.
Conclusions
Therapeutic alliance is an important aspect of the illness and care experience for children with cancer
and their families. Drawing from longitudinal medical dialogue across an advancing illness course, we
identified 7 core themes associated with therapeutic alliance: human connection, empathy,
presence, partnering, inclusivity, humor, and honesty. These findings offer a framework to support
clinician education and future opportunities to study key stakeholder perspectives on approaches to
optimize therapeutic alliance among oncologists, patients, and their families.
