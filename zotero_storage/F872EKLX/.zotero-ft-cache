Abstract
In the field of psychotherapy, scientific research has highlighted the importance of
empathy and therapeutic alliance in regard to the effectiveness and better results of
psychological treatments. In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs)
have shown to be effective at increasing empathy and therapeutic alliance and how
this could affect the patients' symptomatology. In this study, we conducted a system
atic review of the effectiveness of MBIs applied to psychotherapists to improve their
empathy, the therapeutic alliance and the patients' symptomatology. Sixteen studies
evaluating the impact of an MBI on some of these variables were identified, of which
six included measures evaluated by the patients whose psychotherapists received
the MBI. The risk of bias of the included studies was analysed following the method
ological standards. We found very different designs and methodologies in the studies
included in this review, with few of them including a control group. The results show
a limited increase in empathy, measured by the psychotherapist, after an MBI. How
ever, the results in therapeutic alliance are not conclusive, as well as the improve
ments in the perception of patients about their symptomatology. It is concluded that
MBIs can have a beneficial effect on the psychotherapeutic practice, through the
development of psychotherapists' empathy. Future research would require new stud
ies with a higher methodological quality, and in which the effects of MBIs on empa
thy, therapeutic alliance and patients' symptomatology and the relationships
between them are analyzed.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Research on the effects of psychotherapy has identified a series of
skills and processes that are activated throughout the therapeutic
relationship and which show a high impact on psychotherapy
outcomes, which translates into an improvement of symptomatology
(Gelso et al., 2018). Key aspects such as empathy and therapeutic
alliance have been identified as essential in any psychotherapeutic
intervention and are crucial in evidence-based psychotherapy
relationships (Norcross & Lambert, 2018).

Regarding empathy, in recent years different studies considers it
an influential variable in the effectiveness of psychotherapy (Elliott
et al., 2011). We understand empathy as the cognitive process by
which one person recognizes the affective and cognitive state of
another (de Vignemont & Singer, 2006) and the emotional process by
which an affective attunement to it is produced (Singer &
Lamm, 2009), without becoming sympathetic or apprehensive
towards the other's emotional state (Decety & Michalska, 2010;
Moya-Albiol, 2018). This ability is one of the foundations by which
the praxis of psychotherapy is moderated (Elliott et al., 2011). In the
meta-analysis carried out by Norcross and Lambert (2018), empathy
was found to be a key element, able to shape the effectiveness of
psychotherapy. Various studies have found an association between
psychotherapist's empathy scores and psychotherapy outcomes,
especially when this variable is assessed by patients (Elliott
et al., 2011; Orlinsky et al., 2003). This relationship demonstrates the
central role that empathy has in the quality of the relationship
between a psychotherapist and their patient (Elliott et al., 2018).
Another of the basic components exposed by Norcross and Lam
bert (2018) with the ability to predict success is therapeutic alliance,
understood as a quality of collaboration and mutual association
between a psychotherapist and their patient (Flückiger et al., 2018;
Horvath & Luborsky, 1993). Bordin (1979) identified three compo
nents of therapeutic alliance: agreement on psychotherapy goals,
acceptance of relevant and effective tasks for psychotherapy goals
and the establishment of a bond of mutual trust between psychother
apist and patient (Horvath et al., 2011). Numerous studies indicate
that therapeutic alliance is one of the variables that has been most
strongly related to successful psychotherapy (Lambert & Barley, 2001)
and, together with empathy, are better predictors of positive results
than specific techniques or approaches applied during the sessions
(Lambert & Simon, 2008; Walsh, 2008; Wampold & Imel, 2015).
Research has been carried out to evaluate the impact of therapeutic
alliance, on a session-by-session basis, on subsequent psychotherapy
outcomes. These studies have observed that the patients' perception
of therapeutic alliance is related to later changes in their symptoms
(Falkenström et al., 2016; Feeley et al., 1999; Strunk et al., 2010; Xu &
Tracey, 2015; Zilcha-Mano et al., 2016). Along these lines, Flückiger
et al. (2018) observed a strong relationship between the therapeutic
alliance results and the effectiveness of individual psychotherapy. In a
recent meta-analysis, therapeutic alliance and psychotherapist's
empathy were found to be related, indicating that one's perception of
the psychotherapist's empathy can influence one's perception of the
therapeutic alliance (Nienhuis et al., 2018). An increase in empathy
can lead to a better alliance between psychotherapist and patient
(Hilsenroth et al., 2012), and this relationship may be reciprocal
(Nienhuis et al., 2018).
Different interventions have been created to train skills that
develop a positive therapeutic relationship. In recent years,
mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been the focus of atten
tion. These interventions have contributed to developing psychother
apist's empathy (Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2019; Brady et al., 2011;
Dekeyser et al., 2008) and the alliance between psychotherapist and
patient (Razzaque et al., 2013), improving psychotherapy results
(Rothaupt & Morgan, 2007).
Some authors indicate that the practice of mindfulness is under
stood through two fundamental components: the regulation of atten
tion in the present moment; and experiencing different life events
with an attitude of curiosity, openness, acceptance and kindness
(Bishop et al., 2004; Siegel, 2007). MBIs contribute to developing
greater regulation of attention and emotions, body awareness and
changes in self-perception (Cebolla et al., 2018; Hölzel et al., 2011).
These mechanisms are the foundation of an improved self-regulation
process, in which a healthy relationship with the present moment and
the search for effective behaviours adapted to the experience are
facilitated (Carver & Scheier, 2011; Vohs & Baumeister, 2004).
In the practice of psychotherapy, these skills can translate into
greater awareness of one's own and the patient's state and a less
biased observation of the development of the psychotherapist
patient relationship at any given moment (Bruce et al., 2010). Davis
and Hayes (2011) conclude that long-term mindfulness practice can
positively influence the ability of psychotherapists to develop their
self-awareness, which, in turn, would help to distinguish their own
experience from the experience of their patients.
The development of the psychological mechanisms that underlie
the practice of mindfulness (Cebolla et al., 2018; Hölzel et al., 2011)
could have an impact on an increase in the achievement and mainte
nance of attention (Jha et al., 2007), as well as in the regulation of the
present experience and the increase of self-awareness, facilitating lis
tening and the adoption of an open attitude towards other people's
experiences (Siegel, 2007). All this can lead to improvements in the
empathic response (Leonard et al., 2018), given that accurate observa
tions of oneself are necessary for the adequate understanding of
others (Decety & Jackson, 2004). Some studies suggest that the
foundation for an effective psychotherapeutic relationship is the
Key practitioner message
• Question: Are mindfulness-based interventions (MBI)
useful for improving psychotherapist' empathy, therapeu
tic alliance and patients' symptomatology?
• Findings: We found a limited increase in empathy in psy
chotherapists after an MBI. We do not found a beneficial
influence of MBIs in the establishment of a good thera
peutic alliance, as well as in the evolution of the patients'
symptomatology.
• Meaning: Introducing MBI in the university education of
psychotherapists could be useful to improve their empa
thy, an essential skill in the effective approach to patients'
situations and symptomatology.
• Next steps: Additional studies are needed to replicate
these findings and to evaluate with standardized proce
dures if an MBI could also increase the therapeutic alli
ance and thus improve the symptoms of patients.

attunement between patient and psychotherapist (Brito, 2013), which
can be achieved through the training of attitudes cultivated in the
practice of mindfulness (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). In this regard, MBIs
applied to psychotherapists have been found to benefit patient health
and symptomatology (Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew, Bachler,
et al., 2007), contributing to the improvement of psychotherapy
results.
In the current literature, we find some systematic reviews that
have focused on analysing the existing evidence so far on whether
the practice of mindfulness can provide specific skills for the practice
of psychotherapy. In one of them, the benefits of MBIs on the empa
thy and emotional competences of health professionals, including
doctors, nurses and psychotherapists, among others, were evaluated
(Lamothe et al., 2016). Another systematic review analysed, without
conclusive results, the effects of an MBI on the psychosocial behav
iour of health professionals, including medical and mental health pro
fessionals, and whether or not these improvements had any impact on
their patients' results (Escuriex & Labbé, 2011). Yet, another review
observed that the implementation of a series of interventions, includ
ing MBIs, could increase empathy in medical professionals (Kelm et al.,
2014). Finally, in a recent meta-analysis of experimental and correla
tional studies, no evidence was found on the benefits of an MBI on
the empathy of psychotherapists (Cooper et al., 2020). However,
there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses that study the
effect of an MBI on the therapeutic alliance or on the effects that an
MBI received by psychotherapists may have on the symptoms of
patients. Despite the above, we cannot assume that only the results in
empathy show that MBIs are effective for psychotherapeutic work.
For this reason, we find it necessary to include in this review the
studies that have evaluated these variables of such weight in the
therapeutic process (Bruce et al., 2010; Norcross & Lambert, 2018).
This leads us to the objective of this systematic review, which
was to synthesize the available evidence regarding the beneficial
effects of MBIs applied to psychotherapists, focusing on studies that
have evaluated changes in psychotherapists' empathy, therapeutic
alliance and patients' symptomatology.
2 | METHOD
2.1 | Search strategy
Searches were performed in April 2021 and repeated in August 2021
on PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science for articles published up
until August 2021. The search was divided into the following families:
(1) MBIs, (2) empathy, therapeutic alliance and/or psychotherapy/
counselling results and (3) psychotherapists (Table 1). In addition,
previous systematic reviews were checked for articles that met the
inclusion criteria (Cooper et al., 2020; Lamothe et al., 2016).
This systematic review was carried out according to the preferred
reporting elements for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
(PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009). The protocol was registered in Open
Science Framework (OSF; registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/
V3YCK) on 29 June 2021 available at https://osf.io/v3yck.
2.2 | Selection criteria
This systematic review focused on MBIs applied to both psychothera
pists who are treating patients, as well as psychotherapists in training
with or without patients, with the aim of improving their empathy and
therapeutic alliance, as well as the psychotherapy results. Results of
mindfulness measures were included to check if MBIs were having a
significant effect on the attainment of these skills.
We included empirical, quantitative, controlled and uncontrolled
studies, in which an MBI was applied to psychotherapists and in which its
effects on some of the following variables were evaluated: empathy, ther
apeutic alliance and/or patient's symptoms. These interventions included
both standardized and widely researched MBIs (e.g., Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction [MBSR], Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy
[MBCT]) and nonstandardized interventions based on learning and prac
ticing mindfulness exercises, with mindfulness as the main focus of the
intervention (all of them grouped under the acronym MBI).
We excluded meta-analysis and systematic reviews, non
experimental studies, qualitative and correlational studies. In addition,
studies that corresponded to pilot versions of more recent studies in
which the results are further explained and expanded upon were
excluded.
2.3 | Selection of studies
Based on each abstract obtained from the electronic databases, two
investigators (EGC and MBB) selected and analysed the studies that
met the inclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, the original study

was read together with a third investigator (AC), and a final decision
was made to include it or not.
A total of 704 studies were found and once duplicate articles had
been eliminated from the different databases, 588 remained to be
reviewed. A first screening applying the inclusion criteria resulted in a
selection of 23 studies which would be read entirely.
Once the expert screening had been carried out and after apply
ing the exclusion criteria, seven qualitative studies, one pilot version
of a more recent and updated study (Grepmair, Mitterlehner Loew &
Nickel, 2007) and a dissertation showing the results of an included
article (Ivanovic, 2016) were excluded, leaving 14 studies to be
analysed. We then included 2 studies that were found in systematic
reviews which did not appear in the initial search (Mills, 2010;
Spragg, 2012). Finally, 16 articles were analysed in this systematic
review. The search and selection processes are presented in a flow
chart (Figure 1).
2.4 | Data extraction
Two investigators (EGC and MBB) independently extracted the fol
lowing data from each of the included articles: authors, year, design,
population, sample, type of intervention, measured results, instru
ments used and main findings. One researcher entered the data into a
table. The second researcher then compared the table with his data,
and the information was checked for accuracy. If there were any dis
crepancies with the extracted data, the first author returned to the
original article to clarify the correct information and correct the data
in the table accordingly.
2.5 | Analysis of the quality of the studies
Risk of bias of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was systematically
assessed using an adaptation of the Cochrane Collaboration tool
(Higgins & Green, 2011). We rated the following aspects: selection,
realization, detection, outcome data and reporting.
Risk of bias of the pre–post trials was assessed with the
ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies (Sterne et al., 2016).
The following domains were evaluated: confusion bias in baseline,
selection bias, intervention bias, attrition bias and result notification
bias. Two investigators (EGC and MBB) independently performed
the risk of bias rating. In case of discrepancies, a third researcher
(AC) was involved, and the corresponding article was analysed to
resolve the discrepancy. Cohen's Kappa Coefficient (Cohen, 1960)
was calculated with the Excel tool (Microsoft Excel, 2017) as a
measure of agreement and reliability among investigators.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Study characteristics
Regarding the studies included in this systematic review, 9/16 (56.3%)
studies reported results in pre–post measures of MBIs or MBCT, includ
ing 3 (33.3%) peer-reviewed journal articles (Hopkins & Proeve, 2013;
Ivanovic et al., 2015; Rimes & Wingrove, 2010) and 6 (66.7%) disserta
tions (e.g., Ballinger, 2013; Hauge, 2018; Mills, 2010). Among the pre
post trials, only 3 (33.3%) collected follow-up measures (Hauge, 2018;
Hopkins & Proeve, 2013; Schomaker, 2013). On the other hand, 7/16
(43.8%) studies were RCT that implemented MBIs, mindfulness and
compassion-based interventions (MCBI), MBCT and MBSR, of which
5 (71.4%) were peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g., Bellosta-Batalla
et al., 2020; Bohecker & Doughty Horn, 2016; Chan et al., 2021) and
2 (28.6%) dissertations (Simons, 2014; Spragg, 2012). Among the RCT,
4 studies (57.1%) collected follow-up measures (e.g., Bellosta-Batalla
et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2021).
A few studies, 4/16 (25%), recorded the results after the psycho
therapy session at pre- and post-MBI times (Ivanovic et al., 2015;
Schomaker, 2013; Simons, 2014; Swift et al., 2017). Except for
1 (6.3%) study that included mental health professionals
(Schomaker, 2013), all had a psychotherapist in training in their
sample.

It is important to note that 1/16 (6.3%) of these studies only
assessed 3 psychotherapists (Newton, 2018). Among the studies that
applied MBIs, there is a great diversity of methodologies and designs.
Regarding the duration of the MBIs, 1/16 (6.3%) study carried out an
MBI of only 3 sessions (Hauge, 2018), while another applied an inter
vention of 9 sessions (Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew, Bachler,
et al., 2007). Another one of these studies (6.3%) carried out the inter
vention during an entire academic year, from September to May,
resulting in approximately 30 sessions (Rissman, 2013). In general, the
only notable differences observed between the studies that
implemented short-term MBIs and those that carried them out in 8 or
9 sessions in the variables evaluated were found in the results regard
ing patient's symptomatology, which will be discussed later.
Among the studies included in this systematic review, 11/16
(68.8%) measured empathy, and 5/16 (31.3%) of the studies measured
therapeutic alliance. Only 2/16 (12.5%) evaluated the patients' symp
toms, with patients being blind to the type of intervention performed
by their psychotherapists. Lastly, 1/16 (6.3%) studies jointly measured
empathy and therapeutic alliance, and only 1/16 (6.3%) collected data
in regard to therapeutic alliance and symptomatology (Table 2).
One of the studies included in this systematic review addressed
the training of MBI instructors (Chan et al., 2021). Furthermore, it is
important to note that some of the psychotherapists who participated
in the different studies had previous experience in mindfulness
(e.g., Ballinger, 2013; Spragg, 2012), while others did not know or had
never practiced mindfulness (e.g., Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew,
Bachler, et al., 2007).
3.2 | Sample characteristics and demographics
The 16 studies included a total of 760 individuals aged between
18 and 74 (M = 28.1, SD = 3.9). Among these studies, 15/16 (93.8%)
were carried out with a sample of undergraduate, master's or doctoral
students in psychology, and 1/16 (6.3%) was carried out with active
psychotherapists. The sample sizes of the reviewed studies ranged
from 3 to 157 participants (M = 52.5, SD = 48) and was predomi
nantly female, with a mean of 80.6% (SD = 19.5) of female partici
pants. In addition, in the 2/16 (12.5%) studies in which an evaluation
of the symptoms of the patients was carried out, a total of
133 patients were included (M = 66.5, SD = 57.5), with a mean age
of 29.9 (DT = 9.15).
3.3 | Data quality
Regarding the quality of the data (Figure 2), the risk of bias of the RCT
studies on selection bias, realization, detection and management of
outcome data is revealed.
First, the selection bias was divided between: the randomized
sequence generation, in which 100% of the studies showed a low risk
of bias because all were randomized, and the allocation concealment,
which explains the method of randomization that was followed, in
which all studies (100%) had a low risk.
Realization bias was also assessed. At this point, the risk of bias
was high for 6/7 studies (85.7%), given that it was impossible for the
participants to be unaware of the intervention, except in one case in
which only patients were evaluated, and they were blind to their psy
chotherapists' intervention. Regarding detection bias, the absence of
blinding of the evaluators is not considered to pose a risk of bias. For
this reason, all studies (100%) have a low risk of detection bias.
Similarly, the handling of outcome data from the studies was
assessed. In 6/7 (85.7%) studies, there were no dropouts, or the cau
ses and times of these dropouts were reported, so there was low risk
of bias. Finally, we found that 7/7 (100%) of the studies showed some
concerns about reporting bias, given that they do not report having
recorded the study protocol. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration
Tool, this is not considered to this imply a risk of bias. Agreement
between reviewers for quality assessment was high (kappa = .90).
The risk of bias of the pre–post studies on confusion bias on
baseline, selection bias, intervention bias, attrition and result notifica
tion bias was evaluated (Table 3).
First, the confusion bias was low for 8/9 (88.9%) studies, given
that they did not have a control group, and intervention was similar
for all participants, except in one case. In 1/9 (11.1%) studies, there
was an intentional inclusion, so the risk of bias was moderate. Regard
ing selection bias, it was low for 3/9 (33.3%) studies in which the par
ticipants' selection was decided based on availability. This bias was

moderate for 5/9 (55.6%) studies, given that the participants chose to
participate or not, so there could be a bias in their motivation. In addi
tion, 1/9 (11.1%) did not report the selection criteria, so the risk of
bias high for this study.
The intervention bias was moderate in 1/9 (11.1%) studies as
MBI participants also carried out a training that included aspects of
mindfulness. However, this factor was controlled. All other studies,
8/9 (88.9%), had low bias as there was no other intervention parallel
to the MBI.
The attrition bias was low for 8/9 (88.9%) studies because no par
ticipant data were missing, or the missing data were reported. In
another study, 1/9 (11.1%), this bias was high given that participant
data were missing and the reasons were no reported. Finally, notifica
tion bias of the results was assessed. All of the studies (100%)
reported all outcomes, so the risk of bias was low. Agreement
between reviewers for quality assessment was high (kappa = .86).

used. In 2/12 of the studies (16.7%) (Mills, 2010; Rissman, 2013) the
Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003)
was used, 9/12 (75%) of the studies (e.g., Bohecker & Doughty
Horn, 2016) used the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ;
Baer et al., 2006), 2/12 (16.7%) (Simons, 2014; Swift et al., 2017) used
the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS; Lau et al., 2006) and 1/12 (8.3%)
(Spragg, 2012) used the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS;
Baer et al., 2004).
In all these studies, a generalized increase in this variable was
observed, indicating that the applied MBIs influence mindfulness skills
in the expected way.
3.4.2 | Empathy
Among the studies reviewed, 11/16 (68.8%) measured the effects of
an MBI on self-reported empathy by psychotherapists. Among the
assessment instruments, 10/11 studies (90.9%) used the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980), a self-report of interpersonal reac
tivity that assesses a broader concept than empathy, and which is
composed of two cognitive and two emotional scales. In this system
atic review, only the perspective taking (understood as cognitive
empathy) and empathic concern (understood as emotional empathy)
subscales have been included, given that fantasy can be understood
more as a measure of absorption of traits than of empathy (Murphy
et al., 2018), and personal distress could hinder the establishment of
empathy due to the contagion of negative emotions in the psycho
therapist (Singer & Klimecki, 2014). On the other hand, 1/11 study
(9.1%) used the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ; Spreng
et al., 2009), in which two factors of cognitive empathy are evaluated:
curiosity and decentration (Hauge, 2018). In one of these studies
(9.1%) (Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2020), self-reported measures were
complemented with an assessment of emotional recognition ability,
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET; Baron-Cohen
et al., 2001), and a biological measure of baseline oxytocin levels in
saliva (Carter et al., 2007). Finally, 1/16 studies (6.3%) in this review
(Newton, 2018) obtained measures of this variable using the Barrett
Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI; Barrett-Lennard, 2015), an evalu
ation instrument designed to measure therapeutic alliance, which
assesses the perception that patients have about the psychotherapist
through four dimensions: empathy, congruence, consideration and
unconditional respect. In this study, the therapeutic alliance was mea
sured, but ultimately, only the results obtained on the empathy scale
were taken into account. Therefore, 12/16 (75%) studies obtained
empathy results.
The results indicate an increase in 8/12 (66.7%) of the studies in
empathy at the end of the MBI. Regarding self-reported measures,
4/12 studies (33.3%) found improvements in the cognitive subscales
at the end of the intervention and one (8.3%) in the follow-up evalua
tion. A total of 4/12 studies (33.3%) observed improvements in the
emotional subscales. One of these studies reported an increase in the
empathic concern scales (Mills, 2010). One study (8.3%) also obtained
an increase in the BLRI empathy subscale (Newton, 2018). In addition,
in the study that included a performance measure and a biological
measure for the evaluation of empathy (8.3%), an increase in basal sal
ivary oxytocin levels was observed (Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2020).
3.5 | Effects on therapeutic alliance
Five studies, 5/16 (31.3%), collected data on therapeutic alliance. All
of them (100%) collected data on therapeutic alliance measured by
the patients, and 2/5 (40%) also measured it through the evaluation
of the psychotherapists. For the evaluation of therapeutic alliance,
2/5 (40%) used the Therapist Presence Inventory-Patients (TPI-P; Geller,
2001). Two of the studies (40%) used the Session Rating Scale (SRS;
Miller et al., 2000) to measure the therapeutic alliance perceived by
patients and psychotherapists, through 4 elements: bond, agreement
on psychotherapy goals, patient's perception of the psychotherapist's
approach and patient's perception of the session. Finally, a single
study (20%) measured this variable with the Therapist Presence Scale
Patients (TPS-P), which was created by the researcher (Simons, 2014).
The results of these studies indicate improvements in 1/5 (20%)
studies in the evaluation made by psychotherapists. An increase was
observed in the score that the psychotherapists made of the session,
measured by the SRS, with respect to the agreement on the psycho
therapeutic goals achieved with their patients (Schomaker, 2013).
3.6 | Effects on patient's symptomatology
Of the sixteen studies analysed in this systematic review, 2 (12.5%) of
them collected self-reported symptomatology data of patients after
applying an MBI to their psychotherapists (Grepmair, Mitterlehner,
Loew, Bachler, et al., 2007; Newton, 2018).
One of the studies (1/2, 50.0%) (Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew,
Bachler, et al., 2007) measured symptomatology with the Questionnaire
of Changes in Experience and Behavior (VEV; Zielke & Kopf
Mehnert, 1978), which performs a quantitative assessment between
relaxation/tension, stoicism/insecurity and optimism/pessimism, and the
Symptom CheckList-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Franke, 2002) that measures
impairments perceived in the last 7 days, both physical and psychologi
cal, through 9 scales—somatization, obsession/compulsion, interpersonal
sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideas
and psychoticism—and which also includes a Global Severity Index (GSI),
which measures basic psychological stress. The other study (1/2, 50.0%)
(Newton, 2018) used the Outcomes Questionnaire (OQ-45.2; Lambert
et al., 1996), a self-report of the perceived symptomatology that gives
an overall score of the result.
As indicated in the previous section, differences were observed in
the results between the study that applied 9 sessions (Grepmair,
Mitterlehner, Loew, Bachler, et al., 2007) and the study that
implemented 4 sessions (Newton, 2018). The results only showed
improvements in 1/2 (50%) of the studies (Grepmair, Mitterlehner,
Loew, Bachler, et al., 2007). In it, lower scores were observed on the
scales of somatization, obsession/compulsion, interpersonal sensitiv
ity, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideas and psychoticism
of the SCL-90-R, in addition to an improvement in the GSI.

measured by VEV.
4 | DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we analysed the effects of MBIs in psycho
therapists, studying their benefits regarding empathy, therapeutic alli
ance and patient's symptoms.
A large part of the studies included mindfulness measures to
verify the effectiveness of the interventions. The MBIs used in the
different studies have been shown to be effective in increasing the
mindfulness variables, regardless of the number of sessions and
the frequency (e.g., Bohecker & Doughty Horn, 2016; Hauge, 2018).
First, when it comes to the effectiveness of interventions, 8 stud
ies found that MBIs are effective at improving levels of empathy.
Among these studies, only 3 of the ones that found these improve
ments were RCT (Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2020; Bohecker & Doughty
Horn, 2016; Chan et al., 2021), so we must take these results with
caution. We observed improvements in cognitive empathy scores.
The one that obtained the best results was perspective taking scale,
measured by the IRI, which refers to spontaneous attempts to adopt
the point of view of others. This ability can be related to the accep
tance, openness and ability to be present developed through MBIs
(Davis & Hayes, 2011). Increases in emotional empathy were also
observed. More specifically, the scale of empathic concern, measured
by the IRI, which is related to the capacity acquired in an MBI to be
more aware, receptive and more in tune with patients during
psychotherapy sessions (Aiken, 2006; Baer et al., 2004; Brown &
Ryan, 2003; McCollum & Gehart, 2010; Sweet & Johnson, 1990).
These interpersonal skills are developed in MBIs (Brito, 2013)
through the training of mindfulness attitudes (Kabat-Zinn, 2003) and
the acquisition of greater attentional and emotional regulation (Hölzel
et al., 2011).
The results observed in this systematic review do not follow the
same direction as suggested by the meta-analysis conducted by Coo
per et al. (2020) regarding the effects of MBIs on psychotherapist's
empathy. The researchers only found a significant relationship
between mindfulness and empathy, although they did not obtain suf
ficient evidence of the possible benefits of applying an MBI for the
development of psychotherapist's empathy. These differences are
probably due to the fact that only studies that applied standardized
interventions of 8 or more sessions, based on MBSR or MBCT, were
included in the meta-analysis, which implied that many studies with
short and nonstandardized MBIs were not considered, resulting in
very few experimental studies.
Despite these results, it is important to note that all but one of
the studies recorded self-reported measures. In this study, biological
measures were collected. Authors found a significant increase in
salivary oxytocin, a hormone related to empathy and social bonds
(Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2020). In this regard, it is possible that the self
reported empathy results by psychotherapists include a series of
biases, due to an overestimation of their empathic abilities.
Regarding the evaluation of the therapeutic alliance, of the 5 stud
ies that measured it, only 2 were RCT (Simons, 2014; Swift
et al., 2017). This variable has been measured in less than half of the
included studies, and only one of them has found any improvement in
the results, which is an uncontrolled study. It should be noted that this
study showed results in the evaluations made by the psychotherapists
themselves (Schomaker, 2013) and not in those made by their
patients. Understanding the therapeutic alliance as a set of holistic
aspects of collaboration between the psychotherapist and the patient
(Flückiger et al., 2018), the measurement of this variable should give
the same information when it is evaluated by psychotherapists as
when it is evaluated by their patients. However, several longitudinal
studies have examined the relationship between therapeutic alliance
and psychotherapy outcomes and have found that patient-measured
changes in the therapeutic alliance are to a greater extent associated
with changes in later symptoms (Falkenström et al., 2016; Feeley
et al., 1999; Strunk et al., 2010; Xu & Tracey, 2015; Zilcha-Mano
et al., 2016). Other studies have observed a relationship between the
results perceived by the patient and those of the psychotherapist
(Flückiger et al., 2018). However, our results indicate that in most
cases, patients perceive that the established alliance remains as it was
before the MBI. This may indicate that there is an increase in the
psychotherapist's confidence or awareness in developing these skills,
rather than an effective improvement in the therapeutic alliance
perceived by patients.
With regard to patient's symptomatology, only two studies
recorded the benefits perceived in patients at the end of an MBI
(Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew, Bachler, et al., 2007; Newton, 2018).
One of these studies was a RCT and found significant improvements
in the symptomatology of the patients (Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew,
Bachler, et al., 2007). It is important to note that in the other study,
they did not have a control group, and the sample included only 3 psy
chotherapists (Newton, 2018), which prevents us from comparing the
results found in each study. Given that there are only two experimen
tal studies that have addressed this question, more extensive research
is needed on the possible effects of MBIs on psychotherapy
outcomes.
As we have previously noted, the results regarding empathy and
therapeutic alliance do not seem to be affected by the duration and
design of the various MBIs applied in the different studies. Further
more, although differences are observed in the patients' symptoms,
we only have two studies that record this variable, and one of them
(Newton, 2018) has a very limited sample, so we cannot compare the
real effects of the MBI on the results of psychotherapy. Given that we
do not have evidence on the effect that the duration and design of
the MBI can have on the results, this factor should be studied more
extensively in the future.
4.1 | Clinical practice implications
These results have a series of implications for clinical practice. First,
although there seems to be a positive trend in the empathy results,
the evidence found so far shows serious limitations in terms of design
792 GARROTE-CAPARRÓS ET AL.
10990879, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2676 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [22/08/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License


and reliability, so more studies are needed to confirm whether MBIs
can be a good option in the training of psychotherapists to develop
empathy. On the other hand, the evidence on the efficacy of MBIs to
improve the therapeutic alliance is scarce, given that most of the stud
ies included in this systematic review did not find improvements in
this variable. However, evidence on the positive effects of MBIs for
the development of therapeutic alliance was found in a correlational
study (Ryan et al., 2012). More specifically, a relationship was found
between sustained attention and the therapeutic alliance and
between nonjudgmental acceptance and the therapeutic alliance. Pos
itive results have also been found in this variable measured by psy
chotherapists in pre-psychotherapy session mindfulness practice
(Stone et al., 2018). Finally, we only have 2 studies that have evalu
ated the symptoms of the patients as a result of an MBI applied to
their psychotherapists. For this reason, we cannot draw conclusions
about the effects on this variable.
Furthermore, the results found after MBIs in terms of empathy
can be expected to relate to improvements in therapeutic alliance. In
this regard, a relationship between the empathy reported by psycho
therapists and the levels of mindfulness and therapeutic alliance was
observed in an experimental study (Leonard et al., 2018). That is, they
found that psychotherapists with higher levels of mindfulness were
better able to maintain an effective therapeutic alliance. In this study,
the authors argue that the ability acquired in an MBI to understand
the other without reacting to their emotions helps to maintain the
therapeutic relationship. Given the limited evidence that we have so
far, it is necessary to continue the research with more empirical stud
ies in which the direct influence of an MBI on the development of
these variables can be observed.
In addition, it would be necessary to consider if the improvement
in empathy and the alliance truly influence the symptoms of the
patients. Understanding that part of the success of the psychotherapy
process involves the improvement of the patient's symptoms
(Lorentzen & Hoglend, 2004), we have very few studies that have
been able to verify its usefulness. Furthermore, this is only a specific
indicator and other variables such as perceived well-being, duration of
treatment or expectations regarding psychotherapy can also be a sign
of the benefits of psychotherapy intervention (Popescu, 2012). If this
were the case, much of the research that we have found so far would
not be providing complete conclusions about the benefits that MBIs
can have in the practice of psychotherapy.
The results in empathy after an MBI have been shown to be
limited, and it is not possible to affirm that they are beneficial for
the development of the therapeutic alliance, nor for the improve
ment of the patient's symptoms. These results raise a series of
questions about the real utility that MBIs can have in the field of
psychotherapy. We cannot know if the improvements in empathy
as a result of MBI have a real effect on the work carried out in the
psychotherapy praxis, given that they do not seem to be related to
improvements in therapeutic alliance. Furthermore, if these improve
ments are only in self-perceived measures by psychotherapists, it is
possible that they are not having a real impact on the patient's
perception and the results of psychotherapy. Despite the massive
use of mindfulness by many psychotherapists and its integration
into daily practice, the impact it has on the practice of psychother
apy has hardly been investigated. Research needs to be expanded,
relying on standardized designs and larger samples of psychothera
pists and patients, to see if the acquisition of skills trained in an
MBI can really have beneficial effects in psychotherapy. In addition,
research on the effects of MBIs on therapeutic alliance and on
patient's symptomatology could have a relevant impact on the train
ing and understanding of various skills in psychotherapy, given that
it would give us a greater number of tools to apply in the field of
psychotherapy.
4.2 | Limitations of the studies included in this systematic review
First, we only found four studies on the effects of MBIs in psycho
therapist in the long term that carried out follow-ups. It may affect
the results in this regard given that it has been shown that MBIs pro
duce a greater effect on behaviour and the acquisition of meditators'
mindfulness attitudes after a few months of practice
(Grossman, 2010; Kabat-Zinn, 2005).
Furthermore, some quality problems were observed in the studies
examined after assessing the risk of bias. Many of the studies (62.5%)
had limited sample sizes, making it difficult to identify small changes
and generalize the results.
Moreover, 93.8% of the total number of participants were still
in training, making it difficult to generalize the results to psycho
therapists who are actively caring for patients. Some research
suggests that the effects of MBIs can potentially vary when applied
to students or healthcare professionals (Smith, 2014). This is
probably due to the fact that the tasks performed during training
and the stress associated with them are different from that experi
enced in professional care (Lamothe et al., 2016). It is also important
to note that just one of the studies addressed the training of
instructors (Chan et al., 2021), which may directly affect the results,
bearing in mind that the skills of the instructor are essential to
ensure a certain level of standardization between studies (Miller &
Rollnick, 2014).
Finally, none of the studies have included the evaluation of
psychotherapists' empathy, therapeutic alliance and patients' symp
toms together, so we do not have a complete model to help us
understand what factors are affecting the improvement of patient's
symptoms. Furthermore, it is difficult to attribute the effect of MBI
on patients' outcomes, as no study examined the mediation effect
of the mindfulness variable in psychotherapists on perceived empa
thy, therapeutic alliance or patient's outcomes. We also found that,
in some of the analysed studies, patients gave their evaluations to
their psychotherapists (Ivanovic et al., 2015), introducing a possible
response bias due to the possible effect of social desirability and
the lack of anonymity that this entailed. All this results in great
difficulty in generalizing the results obtained by each of these
studies.

4.3 | Limitations of this systematic review
First of all, it is important to note that the inclusion criteria for this
systematic review contemplated only studies that performed quanti
tative analyses, so that a high number of studies that dealt with the
effects of MBI on the psychotherapy process and results were left out
because they only included qualitative results. Furthermore, studies
with different methodologies in which mindfulness practices were
applied pre-psychotherapy sessions and evaluated the effects
obtained after each session were excluded from this review (Dunn
et al., 2012; Stone et al., 2018).
Second, there are a number of variables that may be affecting the
results obtained in the studies and that were not taken into account
when searching and selecting articles. No distinction was made
between the psychotherapeutic orientations of the participants,
despite the fact that some of them may have similarities with skills
trained in an MBI, such as some third-generation psychotherapies or
the acceptance and commitment therapy (Moñivas et al., 2012). Addi
tionally, there was no distinguishment between the different types
and levels of symptoms of the patients who participated in the
studies.
4.4 | Future lines of research
In future research, it will be necessary to include the evaluation of
control groups in order to obtain reliable results regarding the effec
tiveness of an MBI on empathy, therapeutic alliance and patient's
symptomatology. Likewise, it would be important to compare its
effects with specific interventions aimed at developing empathy and
therapeutic alliance. In this way, we could evaluate whether MBIs pro
vide additional benefits with respect to current interventions aimed at
training psychotherapists (Barone et al., 2005).
In addition, it is necessary to apply standardized MBIs to make
the comparison of the results obtained after the practice of mindful
ness more accessible. Along these lines, it would be very interesting
to study whether the reduced MBI versions that we found are
equally effective as a standardized and protocolized MBI, at the
level of results obtained by psychotherapists and their patients.
Similarly, there are interesting initiatives to evaluate the effects of
mindfulness training in psychotherapists from a different methodo
logical framework. In this regard, studies which carry out brief
mindfulness sessions before psychotherapeutic work could be also
analysed in depth. It would also be interesting to see the role that
Compassion-Based Interventions (CBIs) play, given that they have
been shown to be more effective than MBIs in increasing empathy
(Brito et al., 2018).
Furthermore, it is important to include follow-ups in the future to
have a measure of effectiveness in the medium–long term, thus being
able to draw more specific conclusions about the effects that these
interventions may have in the psychotherapy practice. Throughout
this systematic review, we have seen how some studies included
assessments that patients gave directly to their psychotherapists. In
this regard, it would be necessary to have measurement and data col
lection strategies that do not imply access by psychotherapists to the
evaluations of their patients to avoid possible biases in the responses
of the latter.
Focusing on the sample of studies, it would be interesting to have
active psychotherapy professionals, given that most studies evaluate
the effects of an MBI on psychology students. This factor prevents us
from knowing the real influence of these interventions on the thera
peutic alliance established with their patients and on the evolution of
their symptoms. Another important aspect to evaluate would be that
of the different psychotherapy orientations. This would give us the
chance to observe if there are differences in the mindfulness benefits
on the development of empathy and therapeutic alliance and if these
results are reflected in the symptoms of the patients depending on
the approach from which the professional works. Furthermore, we
have a great variety of contexts in the different studies; in some of
them, the psychotherapy evaluation is carried out in hospitals
(e.g., Grepmair, Mitterlehner, Loew, Bachler, et al., 2007) and others in
private consultations (e.g., Swift et al., 2017) or in universities
(e.g., Bellosta-Batalla et al., 2020). This means that professionals face
different levels of stress that we find patients with different socio
economic levels, a great variety of profiles—psychotherapists and
patients from different countries, ethnicities and ages—in addition to
different levels of severity in terms of patient's symptomatology. This
is a field that has not been explored, and it may be interesting to study
it in future research to expand our knowledge of the different con
texts of psychotherapeutic practice and their impact on patient's out
comes. Finally, we also find it necessary to investigate in a controlled
manner the level of previous practice in mindfulness of psychothera
pists to see if this can influence the results. In many studies in this sys
tematic review, we have observed that some of the participants had
previous experience in mindfulness and others did not
(e.g., Hopkins & Proeve, 2013), which is a clear limitation when com
paring the data of one and the other.
Regarding the effects on patients, it is necessary to increase the
studies in which the influence of MBI on symptoms is evaluated and
include some relevant variables that give us information about the
benefits of psychotherapy (Lorentzen & Hoglend, 2004). It would be
interesting to have measures of well-being, life satisfaction (Cuadra
Peralta et al., 2010) and satisfaction with psychotherapy (Brady
et al., 2011) or even on the perception that patients have about the
effectiveness of the sessions (Ivanovic, 2016).
There are very few studies that evaluate the impact of MBIs on
the therapeutic alliance and on patient's symptomatology, and the
studies that we found do not obtain conclusive results. For this rea
son, it is necessary to expand research in this regard to better under
stand the impact of these interventions in the field of psychotherapy.
In future studies, it is also important to have complete models
that evaluate both the development of empathy and the established
therapeutic alliance, as well as the repercussions this has on the psy
chotherapeutic results observed in their patients. It would be equally
interesting to carry out statistical models that allow us to analyse the
relationships between the psychotherapists' results and the results of

specific conclusions about the effects of an MBI in psychotherapy.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review has analysed the available studies on the
effects of MBIs on empathy, therapeutic alliance and the symptomatic
evolution of patients. Results are limited in terms of increases in
psychotherapist-evaluated empathy after an MBI. On the other hand,
we do not have enough results that demonstrate a beneficial influ
ence of MBIs in the establishment of a good therapeutic alliance, as
well as in the evolution of the patients' symptoms. Despite the scant
evidence found in the studies in this review, other correlational and
qualitative research has found that these interventions may represent
a beneficial strategy in the training of psychotherapists, in order to
improve psychotherapeutic practice and thus increase the benefits
obtained by their patients (Dekeyser et al., 2008; Razzaque
et al., 2013; Rothaupt & Morgan, 2007). The study of the relationship
between psychotherapists and patients is an added difficulty to
research in psychotherapy, given that it is extremely difficult to have a
significant sample of psychotherapists who want to participate in
research together with their patients, whose information must remain
anonymous and confidential. In addition, it is complicated to evaluate
them during the duration of the investigation, even more so if a
follow-up evaluation is included, given that in many cases, the
patient's measurements must be collected indirectly. Finally, the dif
ferent evaluation methodologies and instruments that can be used to
measure these variables allow different conclusions to be drawn from
the results. For example, some empathy instruments offer global out
come measures (TEQ; Spreng et al., 2009), while others offer a variety
of subscales that classify between cognitive or emotional empathy
(IRI; Davis, 1980). For all this, it is necessary in the future to have
studies with higher quality methodologies and designs, as well as with
more homogeneous populations and standardized MBIs to be able to
make comparisons between the different results.
