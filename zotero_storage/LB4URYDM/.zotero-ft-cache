nger is intricately linked to symptoms of depression and as implications for functioning outcomes in romantic coules. There is a lack of research on whether symptoms of epression influence empathic accuracy of anger in coules, as well as whether perceptions of anger impact relaonship quality for both partners. Using daily diary data, e examined these outcomes among 79 cohabitating coules (n = 158). Participants completed a baseline survey ssessing relationship satisfaction and depression, as well s daily surveys rating their mood, their perception of their artner’s mood, and relationship satisfaction and closeess. Results indicated that partners of individuals with igher depressive symptoms display empathic inaccuracy f anger. They evidenced a bias towards perceiving higher articipant anger even when participants themselves report w levels of anger or low overall negative affect. Partner ias towards perceiving their partners as angry predicted oorer ratings of relationship satisfaction and closeness om both partner and participant perspectives. Findings ggest that for couples in which one individual struggles ith symptoms of depression, empathic inaccuracy of nger or biased perception of anger may be a mechanism y which interpersonal dysfunction is maintained.

HILE MOST commonly associated with sadness, epression has been frequently linked with heightned experience of other negative emotions ottenberg, 2005). Among these, anger has been ighlighted as particularly salient, with theories ggesting that depression is an expression of nger towards oneself (Busch, 2009; Luutonen, 007), or that anger is a secondary emotion develping from sadness (Greenberg & Watson, 2006). uch theories suggest that ineffective behaviors .g., learned helplessness and inaction) and negave cognitions (e.g., about oneself) fuel the recipcal relation between anger and depressive mptoms. Subsequently, a breadth of research as examined this relation in individuals diagosed with major depression (Brody et al., 1999; ava & Rosenbaum, 1998; Moreno et al., 1994; ude et al., 2012; Schless et al., 1974) or experincing nonclinical levels of depressive symptoms ridewell & Chang, 1997; Clay et al., 1993). Individuals with major depressive disorder DD) have been found to experience greater vels of anger compared to healthy controls oldman & Haaga, 1995; Pasquini et al., 2004; iley et al., 1989), and elevated internal experince of anger has been linked to poor or ineffective utward expression of anger, such as through nger attacks (Fava & Rosenbaum, 1998). Experince and expression of anger may contribute to the ell-documented link between depression and oor functioning in intimate relationships (e.g., arson & Kouros, 2022; Gordon et al., 2013; arris et al., 2006; Katz et al., 1999; Kouros

et al., 2008; Overall & Hammond, 2013; Tolpi et al., 2006). Research has shown that expression of anger and depressive symptoms are respectivel negatively associated with relationship quality an interpersonal functioning in couples (MacKenzi et al., 2014; Renshaw et al., 2010). When com pared to healthy couples, couples with depressio symptomology report greater experiences of nega tive affect, fewer experiences of positive affect lower frequency of positive verbal behavior, an greater negative verbal and nonverbal behavio (Ruscher & Gotlib, 1988; Whiffen et al., 2001) To reduce confusion when discussing the tw members of a relationship, we will refer to th member experiencing depressive symptoms as th participant and their partner as the partner.

Given that both anger and depressive symptom affect relationship functioning, it may be especiall important that partner perception of participan anger matches the participant’s own rating of thei anger. This type of interpersonal emotion process ing is termed empathic accuracy, or an individual’ ability to identify the emotions, mood, or affect o another individual accurately, based on th reported emotional experience of that individua (Ickes, 1993). Thus, this construct deals with th correspondence between partner perception o participant mood and participant report of thei own mood, rather than the accuracy of the partne or participant report (Rum & Perry, 2020). Whil empathic accuracy has been primarily measure using lab-based dyadic interaction or emotiona story paradigms, some recent investigations hav leveraged ecological momentary assessment dat (De Ridder et al., 2016; Gadassi et al., 2011) These investigations engage in statistica approaches that emphasize inclusion of both part ner and participant variables of interest (e.g. affect, depressive symptoms, inferences of eac other’s mood states) in models of empathic accu racy. In line with this approach, conceptuall empathic accuracy is heavily influenced by charac teristics of the individual and the relationshi (Hall & Schmid Mast, 2007; Hodges et al., 2015) Within heterosexual couples, women’s depres sive symptoms have been associated with thei male partner’s lower empathic accuracy of thei negative emotions (Gadassi et al., 2011). Specifi to anger, partners have difficulty evaluatin expressions of anger in participants with depres sive symptoms (Harris et al., 2006; Papp et al. 2010). Papp and colleagues (2010) looked at th relation between depressive symptoms an empathic accuracy in heterosexual couples after lab-based marital conflict task and found tha partners displayed lower accuracy in identifyin
participant anger when participants had highe levels of depressive symptoms. Their findings whe looking at empathic accuracy of other participan emotions in the context of depressive symptom were mixed and seemed to be gender specific when participants had higher levels of depression wives had lower empathic accuracy of fear an husbands had higher empathic accuracy o sadness. Poor empathic accuracy of anger in the contex of depressive symptoms may be related to specifi partner or participant factors. For the participant symptoms of depression may result in intense neg ative mood states (Watson et al., 1988), difficult differentiating between their own negative emo tional states (Demiralp et al., 2012; Thompso et al., 2021; Willroth et al., 2020), and subsequen challenges effectively expressing their present emo tional state to their partners. Participants may par ticularly struggle to effectively express anger, wit research finding that, due to symptoms of depres sion, participants display reduced facial expressio of all emotions, including anger (Renneberg et al. 2005), as well as explosive outbursts (Fava Rosenbaum, 1998). As ineffective anger suppres sion followed by anger expression has been linke to higher depression symptom severity (Koh et al. 2005), poor anger regulation and expression ma contribute to partner difficulty in reading partici pant anger. For the partner, frequent attempts t understand participant mood may cause burnout which may in turn lead to increased reliance o generalizations, or top-down schemas, about par ticipant mood. Given depressed participants’ ten dency to experience and ineffectively expres anger, partners may thus display a bias to perceiv the participant as angry, even on days the partici pant is not angry. Taken together, it is understand able, then, that empathic accuracy of anger ma suffer in the context of depression symptoms. As empathic accuracy is further crucial t strong relationship satisfaction and functionin (Ickes et al., 2005; Rum & Perry, 2020; Sene et al., 2017; Zaki et al., 2013), difficulties relate to this interpersonal emotion mechanism ma detract from relationship experience (Wilde Dozois, 2019). The dyadic partner-schema mode of relationship distress and depression (Wilde Dozois, 2019) suggests that negative interpersona schemas build poor communication and behav ioral patterns within couples. Extending past wor identifying both anger/hostility and depression a unique predictors of relationship distress in cou ples (MacKenzie et al., 2014; Renshaw et al. 2010), empathic inaccuracy of anger and partne bias towards identifying the participant as angr

ay propagate a cycle of poor interpersonal interctions and low relationship satisfaction and closeess for both partners. As it stands, there is little search on empathic accuracy of anger and parter biased perception of anger in participants with epressive symptoms. Understanding how these cio-emotional mechanisms influence relationip functioning in daily life could illuminate clinal intervention targets for couples with epressive symptoms.

In the present study, both members of cohabiting couples provided daily assessments of their wn and their partner’s mood, as well as their wn relationship quality over a 3-week period. his allowed for an ecologically valid approach understanding relations between these varibles. Previous findings emphasize the salience of nger in the context of depression (Goldman & aaga, 1995; Ka ́zmierczak et al., 2023; Riley t al., 1989), identify challenges in partner mpathic accuracy of anger due to participant epressive symptoms (Harris et al., 2006; Papp t al., 2010), and suggest that partners may evience a generalized tendency to perceive anger in articipants with depressive symptoms. Models f relationship functioning (MacKenzie et al., 014; Renshaw et al., 2010) suggest that such cio-emotional mechanisms of anger may be releant to relationship experience for both partners. hus, we hypothesize the following:
. Given the salience of anger in depression (e.g., oldman & Haaga, 1995), regardless of daily articipant anger level, partners will report higher aily participant anger when participants have igher baseline depressive symptoms.
. Given past research highlighting empathic inaccucy of anger in the context of depression (e.g., arris et al., 2006), the relation between daily articipant anger and daily partner report of parcipant anger will be attenuated by participant epressive symptoms. Specifically, partners of dividuals with higher depressive symptoms will e less empathically accurate, reporting persisntly higher levels of anger in the participant gardless of the participant’s own daily report f anger.
. Considering both the prevalence of anger and mpathic inaccuracy of anger in the context of epression, the relation between daily participant egative affect and daily partner report of particant anger will also be attenuated by participant epressive symptoms, such that partners of indi
viduals with higher depressive symptoms will report persistently higher levels of anger in the participant regardless of the participant’s own daily report of negative affect.
. Given prevailing models of relationship functiong highlighting the impact of socio-emotional echanisms, partner perception of anger will negtively impact ratings of baseline relationship satfaction, daily relationship satisfaction, and motional closeness for both the partner and articipant.
As supplementary analyses, we also sought to plicate Papp and colleagues’ (2010) findings. e examined whether partners of individuals with igher depressive symptoms would be less empathally accurate due to reporting persistently higher vels of sadness or anxiety in the participant gardless of the participant’s own daily report f sadness or anxiety. We thus aimed to better nderstand whether, in the context of depressive mptoms, there was evidence for a more general attern of empathic inaccuracy or whether this accuracy was specific to anger.
Method
articipants
articipants in this study were taking part in a larer project that assessed emotional and sleep funconing in couples (Herr et al., 2024). That study is gistered at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ GCMD where we report additional information bout how we determined our sample size, all data xclusions and all measures in this study. The samle used in the present study consisted of 79 ohabiting romantic partners (158 participants), f which 71 were male-female pairs, 2 were ale-male pairs, and 6 were female-female pairs. articipants were recruited via postings on neighorhood listservs, online message boards, and leafts distributed in the community of a large Midtlantic urban area. Eligibility criteria were: being etween the ages of 18 to 65, having been in the mantic relationship for a minimum of 12 onths, currently cohabitating with their partner r a minimum of 2 months, and having daily ternet access. Average age of the participants as 33.6 years (SD = 8.1; range = 19–61) and the verage relationship length was 7.7 years D = 6.3; range = 1.2–34.5). While 84 couples ere recruited for the study, 4 were excluded from e present analysis due to at least 1 partner comleting too few of the daily diary assessments (i.e., ss than 7 out of 21) and 1 was excluded due to ccidental data loss when both partners used the

measures
Baseline
Demographics. Demographic information w measured by self-report and collected informatio including race, gender, ethnicity, age, and relation ship length.
Relationship satisfaction. Relationship satisfa tion was measured using the Couples Satisfactio Index (4-item; CSI; Funk & Rogge, 2007). Usin principal component analysis and Item Respons Theory, the CSI was developed from a collectio of 180 items commonly used in measuring rela tionship and marital satisfaction. The CSI is single-dimension self-report measure on whic three of four items are scored on a 6-point scal and one item on a 7-point scale. The CSI ha strong convergent validity in relation to other sim ilar measures (Funk & Rogge, 2007). In the pre sent study, internal consistency was excellen (Cronbach’s a = .91). Depression. Depression was measured using th Center for Epidemiological Studies Depressio (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The CES-D is a 20-ite self-report measure on which participants ar asked to indicate their experience with severa symptoms typical of depression over the pas week. Each statement is scored on a 4-point scale The CES-D has been found to have strong reliabil ity and validity as a screener tool for depressiv symptoms in general populations and primary car settings (Radloff, 1977; Vilagut et al., 2016). I the present study, internal consistency was goo (Cronbach’s a = .73).
Daily Measures Daily Affect (Self and Partner). Daily emotion state was measured using the Profile of Moo States (POMS; McNair et al., 1971). Each evening participants received the prompt “To what exten have you experienced the following in the past 2 hours?” They would subsequently indicate, on a 5 point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (ex tremely) how much they experienced each of 1 positive and negative words linked to various emo tional states. Emotional state total scores wer computed (specific words listed in parentheses) anger (angry, peeved, annoyed), depression (sad hopeless, worthless), anxiety (on edge, nervous
anxious), vigor (lively, cheerful, vigorous), an relaxed (calm, relaxed, at ease) mood states. Over all negative affect (NA) was the sum of the anger depression, and anxiety subscales. Internal consis tencies of the subscales were all good (Cronbach’ a range: .76 to .88), as were overall NA (Cron bach’s a = .88). Vigor and relaxed subscales wer not utilized in any analyses. Participants were also prompted, “To wha extent have you perceived your partner havin the following feelings in the past 24 hours,” an rated their partners on the same emotion word using the same rating scale. Internal consistencie of the subscales were all good (Cronbach’s range: .75 to .90), as were overall NA (Cronbach’ a = .88) and PA (Cronbach’s a = .85). Emotional Closeness. Daily emotional closene was measured by a single item on which partici pants reported their feeling of emotional closenes over the last 24-hours toward their partner on a 7 point scale from 1 = not at all to 7 = extremely They responded to the question, “How emotion ally close did you feel to your partner today?” Relationship Satisfaction. Daily relationshi satisfaction was measured by a single item o which participants reported their feeling of satis faction with their relationship over the last 24 hours on 6-point scale from 0 = extremel unhappy to 6 = perfect. They responded to th question, “Please indicate the degree of happiness all things considered, of your relationship.”
procedure
This study received ethics approval from th American University institutional review boar [IRB#14216]. Interested participants read an acknowledged an online informed consent for and completed a screening and demographics sur vey. After confirming eligibility, participants com pleted informed consent, a baseline assessment i the laboratory or in a community library meetin room, depending on preference, and were intro duced to daily diary procedures. Participants the individually completed the baseline questionnair (CSI, Demographics) along with several othe symptom measures not included in the presen study. Over the next three weeks, participant completed a daily survey of self-reported affect perception of partner affect, emotional closeness and other daily behavioral ratings not include in the present study, approximately 2 hours befor going to bed each evening. Across all participants 3028 of 3318 (91.3%) daily surveys wer completed.

ata analytic approach
o examine the relation between daily partner pereption of participant anger and daily participant motion ratings, data were treated as multilevel iven the structure of days (level 1) within partners evel 2) within couples (level 3) and analyzed sing the mixed procedure in SPSS V28. Level 1 redictors were person-mean centered to evaluate dividualized fluctuations of affect, while level 2 redictors were grand mean centered. Analyses sed all available data and handled missing data nder a missing at random assumption. Residuals f all analyses were examined for skew and kurtos, with no violations of model assumptions und. Because some dyads were same-sex while ther were different-sex couples, we considered ll dyads as indistinguishable (i.e., dyad members ould not be ordered based on a meaningful varible, such as sex). For tests of our first three hypotheses and the pplementary analyses, partner-rated participant ood (i.e., anger, sadness, anxiety) was used as e dependent variable. Given partner-rated parcipant negative mood states were the dependent ariables, we controlled for the partner daily port of their own NA to eliminate the bias that artners’ own affect may introduce to their percepon of participant mood. In models where the teraction was significant, we examined simple near effects to determine whether the indepenent variable was significantly related to the outome at +1 standard deviation and -1 standard eviation of the moderator. For tests of our fourth hypothesis, partner or articipant ratings of daily emotional closeness, aily relationship satisfaction, or baseline relationip satisfaction were the dependent variables. For e dependent variables that were daily, data was eated as multilevel in line with analyses for the rst two hypotheses. For the model in which basene relationship satisfaction was the outcome, ultiple linear regression was used, and each daily redictor variable included in this model reprents the aggregated mean of the variable in uestion. We ran post-hoc power analyses for our multivel models by following the procedures of Lane nd Hennes (Lane & Hennes, 2018), who recomend using a simulation study to determine the equency in which a given result remains signifiant in many simulations of an analysis. We used e Monte Carlo procedure in Mplus (Muth ́en & uth ́en, 1998) with 1,000 simulations to examine ur primary analyses. Adequate power was
chieved (1 b > .80) for all analyses except one, hich is noted below.

Participant-reported daily anger (M = 6.48 f 20, SD = 2.88), daily sadness (M = 5.33 of 20, D = 2.24), and daily anxiety (M = 6.20 of 20, D = 2.80), ranged from low to moderate. Daily artner perception of participant anger (M = 6.42 f 20, SD = 2.95) was rated near moderate. Across articipants, baseline relationship satisfaction = 15.93 of 21, SD = 3.96) was reported as igh, and daily emotional closeness (M = 4.42 of , SD = 1.48) and daily relationship satisfaction = 4.1 of 6, SD = 1.48) were moderate.
artner perception of participant
nger
ypothesis 1 stated that, regardless of daily particant anger level, partners would perceive higher aily participant anger when participants had igher baseline depressive symptoms. To test this, e examined the main effect of participant depreson and participant anger on partner perception f participant anger. We found a significant main ffect of participant depressive symptoms, daily articipant anger, and the control variable (daily artner NA) on higher partner ratings of particiant anger (see Table 1).
artner empathic accuracy of
articipant anger
e then examined hypothesis 2, whether the relaon between daily participant anger and daily artner report of participant anger was attenuated y participant depressive symptoms, such that artners of participants with higher depressive mptoms would report persistently higher levels f participant anger. To test this, we ran the same odel as for hypothesis 1, then examined the teraction between participant depression and aily participant anger. As shown in Table 1, there as a significant interaction between daily particant anger and participant baseline depressive mptoms predicting daily partner perception of articipant anger. Depicted in Figure 1, this interction suggests a stronger relation between particant anger and partner perception of participant nger among participants with lower levels of

Our third hypothesis extended hypothesis 2 t examine whether the relation between daily partic ipant NA and daily partner report of participan anger would also be attenuated by participan
depressive symptoms, such that partners of indi viduals with higher depressive symptoms woul display persistently higher ratings of participan anger, regardless of the participant’s own dail reported level of NA. As shown in Table 2, ther was a significant interaction between daily partic ipant NA and participant baseline depressiv symptoms predicting daily partner perception o participant anger. As shown in Figure 2, this inter action, like that which was found in hypothesis 2 suggests that partners of participants with highe levels of depressive symptoms displayed a bia towards perceiving anger in the participant.

elationship outcomes
or our fourth hypothesis we predicted that parter perception of participant anger would be negtively related to ratings of relationship quality om both the partner and participant perspective. o test this, we ran models with baseline or daily lationship quality variables as the outcome preicted by daily partner perception of anger and ontrolling for participant depressive symptoms
nd daily participant anger. Controlling for daily articipant anger allowed us to examine the effect f partner bias towards seeing anger on relationip outcomes. As shown in Table 3, we found at partner perception of participant anger was significant predictor of all partner-reported relaonship quality outcomes. Partner perception of articipant anger was further a significant predicr of participant reported daily relationship satisction and daily emotional closeness, but not articipant baseline relationship satisfaction.

There were sig nificant main effects such that higher perceptio of participant sadness was predicted by daily part ner NA, daily participant sadness, and baselin participant depressive symptoms. Similarly, ther was no significant interaction between participan baseline depressive symptoms and daily partici pant anxiety predicting partner perception of par ticipant anxiety.

Discussion
The present study examined the relation betwee participant depressive symptoms and their roman tic partner’s empathic accuracy of anger and bia towards perceiving anger. We also sought to deter mine if partner perception of participant anger wa related to relationship quality for both partners We focused on anger because it has been show to be a salient emotion in the context of depressiv symptoms, and may confer challenges for relation ship functioning (Carson & Kouros, 2022 MacKenzie et al., 2014; Renshaw et al., 2010).
We found that participant depressive symptom were significantly related to partner perception o participant anger. This aligns with our hypothesi that, in couples, symptoms of depression confe risk for heightened perception of anger. Further when participant depressive symptoms were exam ined as a moderator of the relation between partic ipant daily anger and partner perception o participant anger, we found evidence for empathi inaccuracy among partners of individuals wit higher depressive symptoms. This empathic inac curacy was because of partner’s persistently highe ratings of participant anger on days when partici pants themselves reported low levels of anger, an aligns with the findings of Papp and colleague (2010). It is possible that this empathic inaccurac is due to participant underreporting of thei “own” anger, and thus partner’s persistentl higher ratings of participant are, in actuality, accu rate inferences of the participant’s anger level Daily diary research, however, has found tha depression predicts a bias towards recallin momentary mood over the past week as more neg ative than it was (Wenze et al., 2013), suggestin that participants with higher depressive symptom might actually tend to overreport rather tha underreport their own anger. A more likely expla nation for this empathic inaccuracy of anger in th

ontext of depression symptoms may be that, due the heightened frequency of anger experiences r those with depressive symptoms (Cassielloobbins & Barlow, 2016), partners of participants ith higher depressive symptoms are primed to erceive anger in the participant even when it is ot present. As evaluations of negative emotions one’s partner may occur more quickly or readily an positive emotions even within nondepressed ouples (Fletcher & Kerr, 2010), the context of epressive symptoms may only inflate this ndency.

The interpretation that partners of participants ith higher depressive symptoms evidence a bias wards perceiving participant anger is further pported by the results of our third hypothesis. e found that partners of participants with higher epressive symptoms perceived anger persistently igher regardless of participant level of daily negtive affect. Findings from our supplementary nalyses also strengthened this interpretation, as ey provided no evidence for partner empathic accuracy of sadness or anxiety due to the influnce of participant depressive symptoms. Notably, is supplementary finding diverges from Papp and olleagues (2010). It may be important to note, o, that daily partner NA predicted higher parter rating of participant anger, sadness, and anxity. While this finding may be somewhat intuitive, provides empirical evidence for momentary ood impacting inference of one’s partner’s ood. Taken together, our findings suggest that artners of participants with higher depressive mptoms evidence a specific bias towards perceivg anger, rather than a generalized tendency to port higher ratings of all participant negative ood states. While it is well understood that empathic inacuracy negatively impacts relational functioning
ckes et al., 2005; Rum & Perry, 2020), it may e helpful to conceptualize how empathic inaccucy and biased perception of anger develop within odels of depression and interpersonal difficulty. he interpersonal integrative framework for epression (Joiner, 2000) and the stresseneration model of depression (e.g., Hammen, 991) highlight that attitudes and behaviors of e individual with depressive symptoms, such as essimism, poor attachment style, poor problemlving skills, excessive reassurance seeking oiner, 2000), and high autonomy (i.e., assertiveess, self-reliance; Daley et al., 1997), contribute interpersonal challenges (Hammen, 2006). pplied to our study, both empathic inaccuracy f anger and biased perception of anger present s mechanisms of interpersonal challenges, and ay be fueled by cognitive and behavioral features f the individual with higher depressive symptoms. hus, in the context of higher depressive sympms, perception of anger may be a particularly portant factor to attend to when supporting lationship well-being. To that end, we last examined whether partner erception of participant anger would predict relaonship quality. Given that we controlled for parter negative mood and participant daily anger and these models, we conceptualize partner percepon of anger here as a cognitive phenomenon that presents an inference about participant level of nger. Partner perception of anger significantly redicted all three relationship quality outcomes r the partner and both daily (but not the basene) relationship quality outcomes for the particiant. We again stress that we cannot comment on hether the partner or the participant is “correct” the report of anger, but rather these findings ggest that partner perception of anger, which ur previous analyses indicated was biased

towards persistently perceiving higher anger whe participants had higher levels of depressive symp toms, adversely impacted relationship quality fo both members of the couple.

These findings align with models of relationshi dysfunction and depression discussed previousl (Hammen, 1991; Joiner, 2000). In general, ou findings suggest that partner perception of ange is linked to a cycle of behaviors exhibited by bot partners, that subsequently adversely impacts bot partners’ experiences within the relationship. Part ners who perceive the participant as persistentl angry may experience high cognitive load, fee burned out, and engage in distancing behavior to reduce the likelihood of conflict. While eac of these sequelae require further study, this chai of events helps inform our understanding of wh partner perception of anger would detract fro the partner’s daily and overall experience in th relationship. A participant, on the other hand may read their partner’s attempts to distance an deescalate as signs of pulling away or lack of com mitment (Overall & Hammond, 2013) an accordingly engage in ineffective behaviors (e.g. excessive reassurance seeking). Participants ma further feel invalidated if their partner vocalize their perception of the participant as angry, whe the participant is experiencing low negative mood While participant baseline relationship satisfactio did not seem to be negatively impacted by thes experiences, we found evidence that on a dail basis such experiences may leave the participan feeling unsatisfied or less emotionally close. It i possible that partner perception of participan anger therefore does not color the participant’ holistic satisfaction with the relationship but doe create daily challenges. Future research shoul examine how specific behaviors on the part of eac partner develop from biased perception of anger t better understand why and how relationship expe rience is diminished for both partners.
limitations
Our research is limited by our brief measurement of daily affect and relationship outcomes, whic may limit a more comprehensive understandin of these constructs. While the brevity was inten tional given the daily diary methodology, futur research may consider examining other compo nents of affect such as intensity, duration, o expression, and other components of relationshi experience (e.g., time together during the day) Future research may also want to examine gende differences across outcomes, as there may be dif ferences in anger expression across gender. Relate to our sample, our study involved primarily non
Hispanic White individuals and solely heterosex ual couples, which limits the generalizability o the findings. Additionally, our research is limite in its ability to explore directionality of the rela tionship between variables. While we examine partner perception of anger as an outcome an as a predictor, it is possible for example that rela tionship satisfaction predicted both daily affect a well as empathic accuracy. Experimental or lab based research may be better suited to examin causality among these variables. We also advis caution regarding our significant interactio between participant baseline depressive symptom and daily participant NA predicting daily partne perception of participant anger. Posthoc powe analysis revealed this finding to be underpowered thus additional replication is needed to ensure th finding is robust. Finally, our research is limited b the use of a nonclinical sample and depressiv symptoms rather than diagnosis. It is possibl our results may not generalize to clinical popula tions with diagnoses of major depression.
conclusion
Findings suggest that partners overidentify ange in participants with higher symptoms of depres sion, particularly on days when the participan reports lower levels of negative emotions, and tha this overidentification contributes to poorer rela tionship experience for both partners. Futur research should explore the mechanisms by whic empathic inaccuracy operates in the context o romantic relationships and if there is a causal con nection between overidentification of anger an poorer relationship quality. Attending to interper sonal emotion processes for romantic couples especially in the context of depression, could b important for improving relationship quality an well-being for both partners.
