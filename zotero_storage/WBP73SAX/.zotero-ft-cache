The impact of a participatory intervention on the therapeutic relationship in mental health
nurses: a multicenter study
ABSTRACT
Aims: To evaluate the effects of an intervention aimed at improving the therapeutic relationship, using the participatory-action research method, in terms of improving the quality of the nursepatient therapeutic relationship.
Design: A single-group pre-post research design.
Methods: Quantitative data was collected between January 2018 and June 2019 using an online form completed by nurses from 18 mental health units (n=95). Data were collected before and after the intervention, which consisted of the design, implementation, and evaluation of strategies to improve the therapeutic relationship through participatory-action research involving nurses. The Working Alliance Inventory-Short, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire and Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index were used. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used together with the Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Two multiple linear regressions models were constructed.
Results: Overall, the intervention improved the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship In addition, the results revealed that, above all, the improvement in evidence-based practice along with a decrease in nurses' personal distress were the factors associated with the improvement of
the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship.
Conclusion: In mental health units, the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship can be improved through participatory interventions that include the implementation of evidence-based practices.
Impact: This research examined the effects of an intervention aimed at improving the therapeutic relationship among nurses working at mental health units using participatory action research. The results show that the therapeutic relationship can be improved through participatory methods where evidence-based practice is implemented and enhanced among nurses, since a better therapeutic relationship along with reduced staff discomfort are determining factors that influence the quality of the therapeutic relationship. Institutional managers should promote participatory group interventions to enable nurses to develop evidence-based aspects of the therapeutic relationship together with expanding personal aspects and self-knowledge.

1. INTRODUCTION


2
In acute mental health units, the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship is the primary vehicle of
care (Moreno-Poyato et al., 2016; Zugai, Stein-Parbury, & Roche, 2015). The successful
establishment of the therapeutic relationship enhances the effectiveness of clinical practice
interventions (McAndrew et al., 2014) and improves patient health outcomes (Kelley et al.,
2014). Despite its international relevance, limited research is available to evaluate intervention
methods that assist nurses in improving the establishment of the therapeutic relationship with
their patients (Hartley et al., 2020). In this regard, participatory action research has been shown
to be an effective method to improve the quality of the therapeutic relationship using evidence
based practice (Moreno-Poyato et al., 2018; Munten, van den Bogaard, Cox, Garretsen, &
Bongers, 2010).
1.1 Background
The concept of the therapeutic relationship has progressively evolved, in parallel with the
professionalization of nursing, acquiring great relevance for mental health nursing practice
(Gabrielsson et al., 2016; McAndrew et al., 2014; Zugai et al., 2015). In the early 1950s, Peplau
conceptualized patient-nurse interactions (O’Brien, 2001). The nurse-patient therapeutic
relationship can be defined as a helping relationship, where the nurse attempts to improve the
health status of the person assisted, establishing an interpersonal commitment and a meaningful
relationship based on mutual trust, eventually establishing a therapeutic alliance (Moreno-Poyato
et al., 2016). This therapeutic alliance is composed of three dimensions: the bond between the
nurse and the patient, the agreement on the therapeutic goals and the agreement on the tasks
necessary to carry these out (Bordin, 1979).
Throughout the relational process, understanding the perceptions and needs of the other person is
one of the main objectives of the therapeutic relationship (Reynolds & Scott, 1999). As a result,


3
from the patient's frame of reference, the nurse can empower the patient and promote skills to
confront and overcome their problems (Peplau, 1997; Peplau, 1988). This makes empathy an
indispensable attribute for the therapeutic relationship, both from the theoretical perspective
(Peplau, 1988; Rogers, 1972), as well as from the perspective of mental health nurses (Gerace,
Oster, O’Kane, Hayman, & Muir-Cochrane, 2018; Moreno-Poyato et al., 2016; Reynolds &
Scott, 1999). Davis (1983) proposed a classification with four types of empathic responses.
These included two cognitive responses: 1) the tendency to adopt the psychological point of view
of others, a dimension the author called perspective taking, and 2) the capacity to imagine the
situation and the feelings of others, termed fantasy. Furthermore, two other types of emotional
responses were described by Davis (1983): 3) the tendency to experience feelings oriented
towards others, such as compassion and concern, which was called empathic concern and 4) the
tendency to react emotionally from the suffering of the other. The latter was labeled as personal
discomfort (Davis, 1983).
In order to establish a therapeutic relationship of quality in mental health units, it is essential for
the practice environment to fulfill optimal conditions, in which protected spaces are guaranteed
to promote a high quality interaction to take place between nurses and patients (Gerace et al.,
2018; Molin, Lindgren, Graneheim, & Ringnér, 2018). Similarly, other factors such as staff
motivation, leadership and prioritization of psychosocial tasks are key elements (Raphael et al.,
2021). Indeed, a frequently cited factor which appears to be an obstacle to the establishment of a
quality therapeutic relationship is the clinical practice environment (Copanitsanou et al., 2017;
Felton et al., 2018). Moreover, there is evidence of an association between an improved
perception of the environment by nurses and a higher quality therapeutic relationship (Roviralta
Vilella, Moreno‐Poyato, Rodríguez‐Nogueira, Duran‐Jordà, & Roldán‐Merino, 2019).


4
Furthermore, Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) aims to support the nurses’ ability to make clinical
decisions using the best available evidence, considering factors such as patient experience and
expectations (DiCenso et al., 1998). The implementation of EBP benefits both patients and
nurses by improving the quality of care and outcomes (Moore, 2017). In addition, in the field of
mental health, several studies indicate that the use of the EBP contributes towards the
improvement of nurses' empathy (Moreno-Poyato, Delgado-Hito, Suárez-Pérez, Lluch-Canut, et
al., 2017), favoring factors that contribute to a greater therapeutic alliance (Moreno-Poyato et al.,
2018). Despite its relevance, although in nursing as a whole, EBP is an embedded and frequently
used concept (McKinney et al., 2019), in the area of mental health nursing its implementation is
often insufficient (Alzayyat, 2014; Hamaideh, 2017).
Among the strategies used to implement EBP among health services, Participatory Action
Research (PAR) is a commonly used method (Abad-Corpa et al., 2012; Munten et al., 2010). The
objective of PAR is to elicit changes using a dynamic method, in our case, in the context of
nursing team clinical practice. PAR methodology is based on the fact that participants' actions
need to be filtered through experience and reflection before improving or changing their practice.
Thus, the use of this method has led to positive effects in the implementation of EBP, as it
produces effects on nurses' knowledge, professional performance, structural context and on
patient outcomes (Munten et al., 2010). In addition, in the context of mental health, the use of
participatory methods has been shown to increase nurses' confidence, allowing them to reflect on
their practice, present ideas and acquire new knowledge (Moreno‐Poyato, Delgado‐Hito, Leyva
Moral, Casanova‐Garrigós, & Montesó‐Curto, 2019).
Although implementation and promotion of the therapeutic relationship constitute key aspects of
the nurses' role, contributing to improved patient outcomes in mental health units, there is poor


5
evidence in the literature regarding methods to improve and maintain sound therapeutic
relationships (Hartley et al., 2020). Thus, it is necessary to increase the existing body of
knowledge in this regard, by providing more evidence to support strategies that improve the
quality of the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship in acute mental health units.
2. THE STUDY
2.1. Aims
The aims of this study were:
a) To evaluate the effects of an intervention aimed at improving the nurse-patient therapeutic
relationship in mental health units, based on the PAR method, in terms of improvement of the
quality of the therapeutic relationship, empathy and competence for evidence-based practice in
nurses.
b) To examine the impact of the intervention in terms of the association between changes in
levels of empathy, competence for evidence-based practice, and perception of the practice
environment with changes in the quality of the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship in mental
health units.
2.2. Design
This study was part of a mixed-methods project entitled MiRTCIME.CAT (Millorant la Relació
Terapèutica en les Cures Infermeres Mitjançant l'Evidència. Estudi multicèntric en unitats
d'aguts de psiquiatria de Catalunya), which aimed to improve the therapeutic relationship in
acute mental health units in Catalonia (Spain). The project was carried out with a mixed
methodology based on a sequential and transformative design (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012).


6
Quantitative methods were used based on a quasi-experimental single-group design with baseline
and follow-up measurements in phases I and III of the project. The second phase of the project
used qualitative methodology, in which the intervention was carried out using the PAR method.
(see Figure 1). This study presents the results of phases I and III.
2.3. Sample/Participants
Information on the study was provided to all the acute mental health units that were part of the
Catalan Network of Mental Health (n=21). The principal investigator presented the research
project and its objectives to each center during informative sessions with the management of the
centers. Finally, 18 units agreed to participate. A nurse from each unit joined the research team
and was in charge of coordinating the study in his/her center and recruiting the nurses from each
unit. All the nurses employed in the participating units were invited to participate in the study
(n=235). Resident nurses who were in clinical practice were excluded from the study. In total,
198 nurses agreed to participate in the study. Ultimately, 95 nurses completed the study. The
study power to detect at least a correlation coefficient of 0.3 in the baseline and follow-up
measurements was calculated at an alpha of 0.05 and was 80% in a bilateral contrast.

2.4. Intervention
An intervention using the PAR method was conducted, aimed at improving the nurse-patient
therapeutic relationship in the mental health units and which corresponded to phase II, or the
qualitative part of the project (TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication)
Checklist was followed). For this purpose, a group was formed at each center by the participating
nurses of the center and led by the nurse who coordinated the study at each center. In this
manner, 18 groups were constituted which were called support groups. Each support group
operated in an autonomous manner throughout the process, except for the moment when it was
necessary to agree on common strategies for the 18 centers. At that time, a main group was
formed by the coordinating nurses who were in charge of conveying the information from each
of the groups. The process was developed in two cycles with four stages each. As can be seen in
Figure 1, during each stage the nurses carried out a series of activities individually or
collectively. The first cycle began with the first stage where the coordinating nurses in the main
group agreed on how nurses should observe their practice regarding therapeutic relationships.
Later, they conveyed the information to each of the support groups at each center. In the second
and third stages, the individual nurses carried out self-observation of their practice, recording this
using reflective journals. In the fourth stage, they compared the results of their observation with
the guide of good nursing practice "Establishment of therapeutic relationships" (RNAO, 2002),
initially individually and subsequently collectively via the support groups at each center. In this
manner, participants moved on to the first stage of the second cycle, where the coordinating
nurses in the main group agreed upon and planned the strategies for improvement that were
proposed at each of the centers' support groups. Later, in stages II and III of this second cycle,
the nurses at each center carried out the strategies and evaluated these individually through


9
reflective journals. Finally, in stage IV, a collective evaluation was carried out at the support
groups in each center and a final evaluation was carried out with the coordinating nurses in the
main group.
The two strategies that were designed, implemented and evaluated in the PAR were:
a) Reserved Therapeutic Space, a strategy centered on the monitoring of the
hospitalization process focused on the patient's health expectations and needs, and which
consisted of dedicating approximately 30-60 minutes per week to working with the
patient in a personalized manner, through individualized interactions with their assigned
patients. This was a regulated and programmed space, in a comfortable, intimate and
uninterrupted environment.
b) Reflective post-incident analysis, a strategy that aimed to improve self-knowledge and
constructive criticism of nurses' responses and interventions to incidents in their clinical
practice. This strategy consisted of carrying out a critical-constructive analysis after the
occurrence of an incident in clinical practice. Concrete and isolated situations such as
violent behaviors (physical and/or verbal self-heteroaggression) towards the staff or
between patients, agitation/containment, suicide, runaways and vital medical emergencies
were categorized as incidents. The nurses had to analyze and reflect on what had
happened together with the rest of the team that had participated in the incident.
2.5. Outcome measures
2.5.1. Primary outcome


10
The quality of the therapeutic relationship was evaluated using the Working Alliance Inventory
Short (WAI-S: Horvath & Greenberg, 1989) in its Spanish version (Andrade-González &
Fernández-Liria, 2015). The short form of this scale contains 12 items. The items are assessed by
the health professional using a scale that ranges from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The score range of
the overall WAI-S is 12-84 points. Higher scores indicate a greater quality of the therapeutic
relationship. This questionnaire consists of three dimensions: (1) bond: the patient-nurse bond,
including empathy, mutual trust and acceptance: (2) objectives: the agreement between patient
and nurse regarding the therapy goals, and (3) tasks or activities: the agreement between patient
and nurse regarding the tasks to be performed.
2.5.2. Secondary outcomes
Empathy was measured following the theoretical framework by Davis (1983; 1994) via the
Spanish adaptation of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (Mestre Escrivá et al., 2004): this
scale measures the empathic capacity of an individual across four dimensions which must be
independently evaluated. Two dimensions are centered on the cognitive aspects of empathy: the
perspective taking subscale estimates the individual’s tendency to see things from the point of
view of the other person, when relating to that person; the fantasy subscale measures the
respondents’ tendencies to transpose themselves imaginatively into the feelings and actions of
fictitious characters. The other two dimensions evaluate emotional reactions: the empathic
concern subscale measures the individual’s tendency to respond with compassionate feelings of
concern in light of the difficulties and anguish experienced by another person; the personal
distress subscale examines the level of anxiety and other self-oriented negative effects which
occur based on experiences of suffering of other people in difficult situations or crises. Each


11
dimension comprises seven items using a Likert scale based on five points. The scores on each
subscale can range from 0 to 27.
Evidence-based practice was measured using the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire
(EBPQ-19) developed by Upton & Upton (2006). The EBPQ-19 Questionnaire consists of 19
items, structured in three dimensions: a) practice, which includes six items (e.g., ‘Tracked down
the relevant evidence once you have formulated the question’, or ‘Formulated a clearly
answerable question as the beginning of the process towards filling this gap’), b) attitude, with 3
items (e.g., ‘I welcome questions on my practice’ or ‘Evidence-based practice is fundamental to
professional practice’) and c) professional knowledge and skills for evidence-based practice
with 10 items (e.g., ‘Knowledge of how to retrieve evidence’ or ‘Ability to critically analyze
evidence against set standards’). Each item scores from 1 to 7, with 1 being the least favorable
value and 7 the most favorable in terms of competence in the application of EBP. The scale
ranges from 19 to 133 points. We used the Spanish adaptation of this questionnaire validated by
Pedro Gómez et al. (2009).
The perceived nursing practice environment was measured with the Practice Environment Scale
of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI: Lake 2002), comprising 31 items assessed based on a
Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 points (1= completely disagree, 2= disagree, 3= agree, and 4=
completely agree). These items are grouped in 5 subscales: (1) nurse involvement in the center’s
affairs, referring to the participatory role and status assigned to nurses in the hospital context at
large, (2) nursing foundations for quality of care, stressing the nursing foundations for high
quality patient care, (3) nurse manager ability, leadership and support for nurses, concerning the
crucial role of nurse managers, (4) staffing and resource adequacy, referring to the need for
human and other resources to provide high-quality care, and 5) nurse-physician relations, which


12
refers to the need for collegial relations. We used the Spanish adaptation of this questionnaire
validated by Pedro-Gómez et al. (2009).
2.6. Data collection
The coordinating nurses at each center were responsible for collecting the informed consent
documents and the nurses' e-mail addresses to provide an individual confidential participant code
to each nurse. The collection of quantitative data, both from phase I and phase III, was carried
out using an electronic form sent to the participants' e-mail addresses. The data was collected
between January 2018 and June 2019, before and after the intervention. The electronic form
included a questionnaire that collected socio-demographic and professional data from nurses, the
WAI-S (Horvath & Greenberg, 1989), the EBPQ-19 (Upton & Upton, 2006), the IRI (Davis,
1983) and the PES-NWI (Lake 2002).
2.7. Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of all the participating hospitals,
and the participating nurses signed a consent form. The consent forms and the completed
questionnaire were given to participants as separate forms, and data were treated confidentially.
2.8. Data analysis
Descriptive data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes
and number and percentage (%) for categorical outcomes. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank
sum test was used to compare the continuous outcomes between baseline and follow-up. For the
main and secondary outcomes, the differences between follow-up and baseline variables were
defined for each outcome. Regarding the interpretation of these new outcomes, values below 0
indicated a lower evaluation, values equal to 0 indicated no change, and values above 0 indicated


13
an improvement in the evaluation. The opposite logic was used for the interpretation of the
distress subscale. The association between the difference (follow-up - baseline) in the quality of
the therapeutic relationship with the difference in the perceived nursing practice environment,
evidence-based practice and empathy was studied using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Two
multiple linear regression models were constructed. The first model aimed to determine the
difference in the secondary outcomes independently associated with the difference in the
therapeutic relationship adjusted for the baseline therapeutic relationship and participants’
sociodemographic and professional characteristics. The second model included the difference in
secondary outcomes with a p-value of < 0.05, according to their association with the difference
in the quality of the therapeutic relationship adjusted for the baseline therapeutic relationship,
participants’ sociodemographic and professional characteristics. The variance inflation factor
(VIF) was used to quantify the severity of the multicollinearity effect. VIF values higher than 5
are considered high multicollinearity (Sheather, 2009). All significance tests were two-tailed, and
values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using the R
3.6.1 for Windows statistical software package (R Core Team, 2019).
2.9. Validity and reliability/Rigor
The Spanish version of the WAI-S has good reliability and validity, with a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.93 (Andrade-González & Fernández-Liria, 2015). In the case of our sample, the Cronbach's
alpha value for the total scale was 0.82.
The Interpersonal Reactivity Index has been validated in Spanish and the Cronbach’s alpha
values vary between 0.63 and 0.71 across the four factors (Mestre Escrivá et al., 2004). In our
sample, the Cronbach's alpha values varied between 0.59 and 0.81 across the four factors.


14
The Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ-19) has been validated in Spanish by Pedro
Gómez et al. (2009) with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.89, 0.72 and 0.92 for each of the factors.
In our sample, the Cronbach's alpha values was 0.94 for the total scale the Cronbach's alpha
values varied between 0.61 and 0.95 across the three factors.
The PES-NWI has been validated in Spanish by Pedro-Gómez et al. (2009) and the Cronbach’s
alpha values for each of the factors were 0.85, 0.83, 0.92, 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. In our
sample, the Cronbach's alpha values varied between 0.77 and 0.92 across the five factors.
3. RESULTS/FINDINGS
3.1. Description of the sample
Table 1 reflects the characteristics of the 95 participating nurses who completed the study. The
nurses were between the ages of 22 and 62 with a mean age of 33.4 years (SD=9.3). Almost 70%
of the nurses were women. Their mental health experience averaged 7.7 years (SD=8.0). Only
23.2% had the official title of mental health nurse specialist and only 22% of the nurses had a
PhD or master's degree. 80% of the nurses had a permanent employment contract. All of the
centers' work shifts were equally represented in the sample.

3.2. The effects of the PAR
The nurses showed a statistically significant improvement in the level of their therapeutic
relationships after the intervention (baseline 61.3 vs follow-up 62.8, P = 0.02). In relation to the
remaining quantitative variables evaluated before and after the intervention, effects occurred in
different directions (Figure 2, Table 2). The nurses improved evidence-based practice
competence, albeit not significantly (baseline 4.9 vs. follow-up 5.0, P = 0.11). In addition, the
score of the perception of the nursing practice environment decreased significantly after
intervention (baseline 2.6 vs follow-up 2.4, P <0.001). Regarding the dimensions of empathy,
although most did not undergo significant changes, the score of nurses' empathic concern did
decrease significantly after the intervention (baseline 21.2 vs. follow-up 19.9, P < .001).

3.3. The association between the effects produced by the intervention and the changes in the therapeutic relationship
The results of the association between the difference (follow-up - baseline) in the quality of the
therapeutic relationship with the difference in the perceived nursing practice environment,
evidence-based practice, and empathy are shown in Table 2. As can be observed, a significant
association was obtained between the effects produced in the EBPQ and the improvement of the
therapeutic relationship (rho=0.328, P =0.001). Similarly, a statistically significant association
was observed between the effects in each of the dimensions of empathy and the improvement of
the therapeutic relationship, with the exception of the fantasy dimension. Thus, it should be
noted that the score for empathic concern, despite having decreased after the intervention, was
associated with an improvement in the therapeutic relationship (rho=0.288, P =0.005). However,
a negative association was found between changes in the score of nurses' personal distress and
improvement in the therapeutic relationship, indicating que a decrease in the score of the
therapeutic relationship is associated with an increase in the personal distress score (rho=-0.214,
P = 0.038). Finally, although there was a significant decrease in the score of the perception of the
environment after the intervention, the results indicate that this change was not related to
changes in the therapeutic relationship (rho=0.119, P = 0.251).
The results concerning the multiple linear regression models are detailed in Table 3. The first
model explained 37.2% of the changes produced in the therapeutic relationship. According to
this model, the improvements in the EBPQ were the factor with the most weight (β= 4.045, P<
0.001), once adjusted for the baseline values of the therapeutic relationship, the
sociodemographic variables and the nurses' professional characteristics. A second model was
then constructed without incorporating the PES-NWI variable that had previously shown no
association in the bivariate analysis. The second model explained 37.4% of the changes in the

therapeutic relationship and once again confirmed that the improvements in the EBPQ were
related to improvement of the therapeutic relationship (β= 4.102, P< 0.001). In addition, in this
second model, a notable finding was the relationship between the decrease of personal distress in
nurses and its association with the improvement of the therapeutic relationship. (β= -0.374, P=
0.053).
4. DISCUSSION
The aims of this study focused on evaluating the impact of an intervention using the participatory
action research method on the quality of the therapeutic relationship and other secondary
outcomes such as empathy, competence for EBP and perception of the practice environment in
mental health unit nurses. It also sought to examine the association between changes in
secondary outcomes and changes in therapeutic relationships. In this sense and according to our
findings, it is worth noting that following the intervention, there was an overall improvement in
the nurse-patient therapeutic relationship. In addition, the results revealed that the improvement
in EBP and the reduced nursing staff discomfort were the factors that were more related to the
improvement of the therapeutic relationship. These results are highly relevant since there are
hardly any published works in the mental health field presenting interventions that have
improved the therapeutic relationship (Hartley et al., 2019). In addition, no studies have been
found that show results of factors associated with change in the quality of the nurse-patient
therapeutic relationship in mental health units.
It should be noted that, although the intervention was aimed at improving the therapeutic
relationship, the secondary outcomes evaluated were also affected. First, it should be noted that a
slight improvement was observed in the evidence-based practice competence of nurses.
Consequently, the results suggest that, as in other settings (Munten et al., 2010), in the context of


21
mental health units, the use of participatory methods is useful for improving and implementing
EBP. In this sense, in the published literature there is hardly any evidence of effective
interventions from a quantitative point of view for the improvement of EBP, since, with the
exception of a study with primary care nurses where significant improvements were obtained in
some dimensions of EBP (Ramos-Morcillo et al., 2015), in other contexts with nurses or nursing
students and with other methodologies, no general improvement in competence was found for
EBP (Moore, 2017; Rojjanasrirat & Rice, 2017).
For the remaining secondary outcomes evaluated, the impact of the intervention varied. In the
case of empathy, as in other studies, there were no significant changes in most of the dimensions
(Avasarala, Whitehouse, & Drake, 2015; Imran, Aftab, Haider, & Farhat, 2013; Rodríguez
Nogueira, Moreno-Poyato, Álvarez-Álvarez, & Pinto-Carral, 2020; Webster, 2010; Zeppegno,
Gramaglia, Feggi, Lombardi, & Torre, 2015). Significant changes were only observed in the case
of empathic concern. In this sense, from the perspective of empathic response as a person
specific situational state, the experiential background of nurses' empathic responses helps the
perspective-taking of the other (Gerace, 2020). Thereby, the decrease in empathic concern
among nurses could be due to a sense of greater security and confidence on behalf of the nurses
in the relationship. This argument helps to explain that these findings could be related to the
method used for the intervention. Considering that it has been shown that the use of participatory
methods helps nurses become more aware of their practice, and furthermore, working in groups
to agree on problems and ways to resolve these generates more confidence and confidence in
their clinical competence (Eddy et al., 2016; Moreno‐Poyato et al., 2019; Oelofsen, 2012).
Perhaps for these reasons, nurses may have decreased their levels of empathic concern.
Similarly, after the intervention nurses’ perception of the practice environment was significantly


22
reduced. This could also be explained due to the excessive duration over time of the intervention
and the personal and professional maturation process of the participating nurses. However, it
could also be related to the methodology of the intervention, since it is known that participatory
methods help nurses to become more critical and therefore, in our case, in the context of the
intervention, nurses rated their work environment more negatively (Petriwskyj & Power, 2020;
Sepahvand et al., 2020).
However, not all changes in secondary outcomes were related to an overall improvement in the
therapeutic relationship. In this sense, the fact that nurses had a poorer perception of their
practice environment was not related to the improvement in the therapeutic relationship. This
could have been due to increased confidence and security in their clinical practice triggered by
changes in empathic concern, as well as the adaptive and resilient capacity of mental health
nurses and their attitude towards care (Foster et al., 2020), therefore, despite rating their
environment poorly, this did not affect them in terms of improving the therapeutic relationship.
This finding should be analyzed in greater depth in subsequent studies since a cross-cutting
relationship has been found between both factors (Roviralta‐Vilella, Moreno‐Poyato, Rodríguez
Nogueira, Duran‐Jordà, & Roldán‐Merino, 2019).
In contrast, improving the competence for nurses' EBP was related to of a higher quality
therapeutic relationship. This result is highly relevant in mental health nursing since it confirms
the importance and relationship between EBP and the quality of the nurse-patient therapeutic
relationship (Moreno‐Poyato et al., 2020). This finding demonstrates that the therapeutic
relationship is not only a construct that can be improved based on the nurses' experience and
other individual characteristics (Alzayyat, 2014; McAndrew et al., 2014), but rather there may be
a structured, evidence-based approach that can guide the clinical practice of nurses towards an


23
improved therapeutic relationship. Consequently, by improving the EBP of mental health nurses,
the therapeutic relationship is improved, considered the most important tool in the care of people
with mental health problems (Moreno-Poyato et al., 2016; Peplau, 1988; Vahidi et al., 2018). In
addition, it should be noted that, among the effects produced on the dimensions of empathy, the
change that was most influential in improving the quality of the therapeutic relationship was the
improvement in nurses' personal distress. This fact is also highly relevant and confirms the
importance of emotional empathy and especially personal distress in the quality of the
therapeutic relationship. (Gerace, Oster, O’Kane, Hayman, & Muir-Cochrane, 2018; Moreno
Poyato & Rodríguez‐Nogueira, 2020). Since personal distress is the way nurses react to certain
situations of patient suffering which conditions rapid decision making at times when there is no
time for reflection (Haas et al., 2015), there is a clear need for self-knowledge and reflexivity on
behalf of nurses working in mental health units.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the single-group design does not allow comparison of
the effect of the changes with a control group. However, this study presents a multivariate
analysis of the effects, which enables the ability to adjust and define the changes that occurred.
In addition, considering that the therapeutic relationship is a multifaceted construct, the amount
of variance explained in the changes affecting the therapeutic relationship was high. Second, the
lengthy intervention period may have increased the dropout rate. However, in most cases the
dropouts were due to service transfer, although in the final phase of the study several dropouts
occurred due to attrition. In any case, one of the strengths of the study was the number of units
and nurses that participated, which allows for generalization of these findings. Thirdly, given the
small effect of the changes produced and the possible influence of the Hawthorne effect on


24
nurses, the results should be considered with caution. Finally, it is important to consider that the
therapeutic relationship was evaluated as a general measure and this was related to the nurses’
overall perceptions on the therapeutic relationship, which could have differed from those of their
patients. Considering that the therapeutic alliance is constructed between two people, a limitation
of the approach used in this study is that the assessment is subject to the nurse's perception of
their relationship with patients in general. Therefore, it would be interesting for future studies to
consider the perspective of the patients. In the same vein, the decrease in nurses' empathic
concern, which could be due to a sense of greater security and confidence among nurses
regarding the relationship, could be perceived differently by patients.
5. CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates that the therapeutic relationship established between nurses and patients
in mental health contexts can be further enhanced through participatory interventions that include
the implementation of EBP. The results of this study show that the associated factors of quality
improvement in therapeutic relationships were improved competence for EBP and decreased
personal distress among nurses.
These results indicate the need to work on both the personal and self-knowledge aspects of
nurses in order to reduce their personal distress in the face of compromising situations, as well as
the implementation of evidence-based actions.
Likewise, the results show that, to improve the therapeutic relationship, considered a central
aspect of mental health nursing, the managers of health centers should consider the need to
implement participatory group interventions where nurses can develop evidence-based aspects of


25
the therapeutic relationship, implement changes in their actions and provide a space for
reflection.
Future research along the same lines should be directed towards further study of the effectiveness
of interventions based on participatory methods, using controlled intervention designs and
measuring outcomes both in nurses and in patients (Patient Reported Outcomes).
