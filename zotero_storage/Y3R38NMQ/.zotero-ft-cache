Abstract:
Humans can show emotional reactions toward humanoid robots, such as empathy. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others’ pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was
Journal Pre-proof investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of
human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.

1. Introduction
Robots are becoming more and more common in our professional lives, especially in areas such as entertainment and rehabilitation robots, as well as affective robots, which can be used for emotional escort (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014; Leite et al.,2013). It’s therefore becoming necessary to investigate the effects of emotions elicited by robots in human-robot interaction (HRI), and whether these effects differ from those to humans. For example, empathy is
Journal Pre-proof an emotional response towards the situation of another person even though one has not experienced
that situation (Decety and Jackson, 2004; Rosenthal-von der Pütten,2013). Recent studies in empathy and affective robotic interaction have found that humans have the ability to empathize towards robots as they do to humans (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014; Leite et al.,2013). One widely used model of empathy involves bottom-up emotion sharing and top-down executive control (Decety and Jackson, 2004; Damiano, Dumouchel and Lehmann, 2015; Decety and Lamm, 2006). Several studies have suggested that information processing during empathy displayed toward robots is similar to that displayed to other humans, which supported the two-level empathy model (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014; Rosenthal-von der Pütten, 2013). Investigating the procedures may help people better understanding the neural activities and functional mechanism of the brain underlying pain empathy and the possible different empathic responses toward robots (Bernhardt and Singer,2012).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating empathy for pain found certain brain regions engaged in empathic responses (Hein et al.,2016; Morrison et al., 2004; Botvinick et al.,2005). Increased neural activity was observed in the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when participants viewed pictures of painful compared to nonpainful stimuli (Jackson et al.,2006; Saarela et al.,2007; Morrison, Peelen and Downing, 2007). The activity of these brain areas also correlates with subjects’ estimation of intensity for observed pain (Jackson, Meltzoff and Decety,2005; Jackson et al.,2006). When subjects observed painful actions towards robots, similar patterns of neural activation in the AI and ACC were observed (Rosenthalvon et al., 2014; Jackson, Meltzoff and Decety,2005; Jackson et al.,2006).
Previous studies suggest that cognitive and neural activities underlying empathy can be investigated using electroencephalograph (EEG) (Suzuki et al.,2015; Meng et al.,2012; Meng,

Jackson and Chen, 2010). EEG records the temporal specificity of neuronal populations involved during elicitations of emotional reactions such as empathy. Event-related potentials (ERPs) induced by images is a good tool for investigating pain empathy (Suzuki et al.,2015), and various specific ERP components can represent the neural activity associated with pain empathy. ERP studies in temporal domain found that the perception of pain empathy fit the two-level empathy model which includes an early sharing response and a late control response (Decety, Yang and Cheng, 2010). It was further showed that both the late and early ERP components can reflect the neural features of
Journal Pre-proof empathy though observing painful and non-painful pictures (Cui, Ma and Luo,2016; Fan and
Han,2008; Cheng, Chen and Decety,2014). Previous ERP based studies have found that compared with non-painful stimuli, painful stimuli elicited more positive shift of ERP waves over the frontal lobe at 140ms (early response) and a long latency empathic response was observed after 380ms (late response) over the central parietal regions. They have indicated that P3 is more modulated by top down attention to pain stimuli and the early components was not (Meng et al.,2012;Cui, Ma and Luo, 2016; Fan and Han,2008).
Previous fMRI studies of empathy have only considered the neuro-hemodynamic BOLD response for different brain areas and indicated the most active regions (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014; Jackson, Meltzoff and Decety,2005). EEG studies mainly focus on the precise temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying pain empathy and disclose the features of different level’s ERP components at different electrodes locations (Suzuki et al.,2015; Jackson, Meltzoff and Decety,2005; Jackson et al.,2006). These studies both showed that empathy towards robots can also be conceptualized as an emotion sharing and executive control process (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014; Bernhardt and Singer,2012). Y. Suzuki et al.’s study indicated that relative to non-painful pictures, painful stimuli elicited larger descending phased of P3 for both human hand and robot hand. Whereas the ascending phase of P3 was increased by painful human hand pictures but not for painful robot hand pictures (Suzuki et al.,2015).
It is known the main components involved in the empathy is a collaborative process for the whole brain (Suzuki et al.,2015; Bernhardt and Singer,2012; Jackson, Meltzoff and Decety,2005). Although ERP based studies can reveal temporal features of neural processing of empathy for pain, previous studies only focused on the ERPs from few channels (e.g. Fz, Pz, and Cz), and no researches investigate the neural responses from the whole brain (Rubinov and Sporns,2010;

Ahmadlou, Adeli and Adeli,2012;Yang et al., 2016). While functional connectivity is a new multidisciplinary approach to investigate the neural mechanism involved in cognitive process (Reijneveld et al.,2007; Pereda, Quiroga and Bhattacharya,2005). It can represent the spatial features of the whole brain and the mutual information dependences between different brain regions. The topological structure of functional networks during a variety of cognitive tasks can reveal the neural activities of different cognitive processes such as memory, reasoning and planning (Micheloyannis et al., 2006; Kitzbichler et al.,2011). Studies also reported that the parameters of brain network are
Journal Pre-proof altered in patient with schizophrenia, stroke, alzheimer’s disease, and other brain diseases (Bullmore
and Sporns,2009; Ahmadlou, Adeli and Adeli,2012,2013; Mirzaei and Adeli,2016). Network’s change can represent the corresponding neural responses under different cognitive condition or some diseases. However, to dates, no functional brain network study has been conducted for empathic mechanism. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the functional brain network of pain empathy, and highlight the possible differences of the connectivity for empathy responses towards humans and robots.
The aim of the current study is to examine the functional brain network of pain empathy towards human and robot hands in painful and non-painful situation. To investigate how painful stimuli affects the topological structure of the human brain, we presented pictures of human and robot hands in painful and non-painful situation to subjects, and recorded the whole-brain EEGs to construct a functional network. Several issues regarding functional connectivity underlying empathy were also investigated. First, ERPs in the two periods were analyzed: early components (N1,N2), associated with empathic arousal which starts from -100 ms to 300 ms after the stimuli onset; and late P3, indexing cognitive appraisal, which starts from 300 ms to 700 ms (Suzuki et al.,2015; Cui, Ma and Luo,2016; Cheng,Chen and Decety,2014; Tonoyan et al., 2016). Second, mutual information (MI) between all pairs of EEG electrodes was calculated and the MI-weighted brain network was constructed, which mainly characterized by clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. Third, combining with the MI value from the network, we proposed an empathy index to characterize the network features and represent the empathy ability of humans. At last, a correlation analysis between these parameters and participants’ Interpersonal Reactivity Index scores (IRI) (Davis,1983,1996), Empathizing Quotient (EQ) (Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright,2004) scores and several emotional responses (e.g. fear, disgust and distress) were conducted.

2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants
In total, 18 healthy individuals (6 females and 12 males, mean=24.7 years, SD=1.9 years, all right-handed) participated in this study. Two of the resulting datasets had to be excluded from further analysis due to the excessive artifacts during EEG recording. All of the volunteers were undergraduate or graduate students recruited from Northeastern University (NEU) through the
Journal Pre-proof university’s community website. The subject participated in this experiment all had normal or
corrected to normal vision, and had no history of psychiatric or neurological diseases, and were paid after the test. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethic guidelines of the declaration in NEU. 2.2. Stimuli and Procedure
The stimuli used in this experiment were colored photographs of human or robot hand with a size of 67×37 (width × height) in pixels. For half of the stimuli, the hands were touched by a toothbrush (non-painful situation), and for the other half they were touched by a knife (painful situation), as illustrated in Fig.1. Left-hand conditions were mirror-reversed pictures of the right-hand stimuli. All pictures were processed in the same software and the same steps. Luminance, contrast ratio and color were matched between painful and non-painful pictures.
Fig.1. Stimuli images used in the experiment. The first line is human hand and the second line is robot hand. Images were equalized for luminance value.
The experiment consisted of three sessions. For each session, images were presented on the center of a LCD screen through SCAN software, with a viewing distance of 80cm to the subject.

Each session included 30 blocks of 300 ERP recording trials. Each block randomly presented 2 model trials (human or robot hand), 2 pain trials (painful or non-painful stimuli), right and left hand trials, and 2 target stimuli trials with randomized order, as illustrated in Fig.2. The target stimulus showed a picture with a question mark on a black background and was added to ensure the subject’s attention was focused on the experiment (Suzuki et al.,2015; Rosenthal-von et al., 2014). Each trial began with a fixation cross in the center of the screen for 1000ms, followed by the images of human or robot hands in either painful or non-painful situations for 800ms with an inter-stimulus interval of
Journal Pre-proof 1200ms. The target stimulus randomly presented during each trial for 500-1500ms, and required the
subject to judge whether the last stimulus was painful or non-painful by pressing one of the two buttons on the keyboard. After making the judgment, a blank screen was presented and the next block continued.

2.3. EEG acquisition and recordings Subjects sit comfortably before a computer screen and were asked to take the third person
perspective to the visual stimuli. EEG signals were recorded from 30 Ag-AgCI electrode positions with a scalp electrode cap. Electrodes were placed according to the extended 10-20 international system using the NuAmps Amplifier (Compumedics Neuroscan, USA). The linked mastoids were used as reference and the medial-forehead electrode was used as the ground electrode. Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EoGs) were recorded from electrodes placed laterally to both eyes as well as above and below the left eyes (2 channels). All electrodes impedances were maintained below 10 kΩ. The EEG signal was amplified with a band pass at 0.01Hz to 100 Hz and sampled at 1000Hz.
Pre-processing of the EEG data was conducted using SCAN (Compumedics Neuroscan, USA) system. Trials with overt incorrect responses were excluded and EOG artifacts were corrected with

ICA algorithm. All signals were filtered with 0.01- 32 Hz band-pass, and EEGs were epoched from 100 ms prior to onset of stimuli and ending at 700ms. All epochs were baseline corrected using the pre-stimulus period. Any epochs with voltage values exceeding 100 μv in any channels were excluded. In this study, we did not consider the difference between right and left handedness. Therefore, we analyzed four conditions, which is Model (human and robot hands) by Pain (painful and non-painful stimuli). The corresponding ERPs of the four situations were derived by overlaying and averaging of the EEG epochs for all the subjects, as illustrated in Fig.3.
Journal Pre-proof Fig. 3. Grand average of ERP responses to painful vs. non-painful stimuli of human and robot in the middle
parietal brain region (Pz) under the four conditions (HNP: non-painful for human hand; HP: painful for human hand; RNP: non-painful for robot hand and RP: painful for robot hand).
2.4. Self-report Measures
In order to measure the self-reported empathic abilities, participants completed two questionnaires including the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and Empathizing Quotient (EQ) one week before the ERP recording. The IRI is a 28-item self-report measure of empathic tendency which contains four subscales, that is perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress (Davis, 1996). The EQ is a 40-item self-report measure evaluating empathy, emotional reactivity and social skills. The corresponding Chinese versions of these questionnaires were used. Following the ERP recording, participants viewed the stimuli again and were asked to rate pain intensity and pain unpleasantness by using a computerized visual analog scale from 0 to10 (0 means no pain, 10 means extreme painful).
2.5. Functional Connectivity

Brain is a large-scale complex network, and cognitive activities and information processing are mainly based on the interactions between distant brain regions. Functional connectivity of the signals from different brain regions can represent the spatial dynamics of the brain and mutual dependences between sub-regions. Previous studies indicated that ERP based functional connectivity can be used to represent the cognitive functions of the brain (Kabbara et al, 2016; Yang, Qiu and Schouten,2015).

Mutual information is a measure of interdependence that represents the relationship between signals, which is based on the information entropy and assesses the amount of information about one
Journal Pre-proof signal contained in another signal. It measures the nonlinear interdependencies between signals and
can represent the information transform between associated brain regions (Pereda, Quiroga and Bhattacharya, 2005). In this study, we want to investigate the information exchange between associated brain regions for the ERP responses of pain empathy, thus the functional connectivity was constructed using the mutual information.
2.6. Brain Network Analysis
Functional network analysis shows the topological connectivity between different sub regions of the brain (Ahamadlou and Adeli, 2011;Wang, Chang and Zhang,2016; Yuvaraj et al., 2016). The connection weights are defined as a matrix of correlation values between signals from different electrodes (based on the MI value mentioned before). We defined network with signals from the 30 EEG channels, and the MI values between the two signals was defined as the edge weight of the network. In this study, we characterized the structure of weighted networks via their clustering coefficient and characteristic path length.
The clustering coefficient of a vertex i represents the likelihood of its neighbors connected to each other (Ahmadlou and Adeli, 2011; Ahamadlou, Adeli and Adeli, 2010; Onnela et al.,2005). Here, the weighted clustering coefficient was defined according to the proposal of Onnela and Stam (Rubiov and Sporns,2010; Onnela et al.,2005), which requires the weights to be symmetrical (wij=wji). Then the weighted clustering coefficient of vertex i is defined as,

∑∑ ∑∑ CiW =

j≠i

w w w k ≠i ij ik jk
k≠ j

j≠i

w w k ≠i ik il
k≠ j

(1)

And the mean clustering coefficient of the entire graph can be determined as,

∑ CW = 1 N

C N W
i =1 i

(2)

Where N is the total vertex count of the network.

For the weighted path length, the definition based on the global efficiency was adopted (Wang,

Chang and Zhang,2016; Ahmadlou, Adeli and Adeli,2010). It defines the length of an edge as the

inverse of its weight, i.e. Lij=1/wij, if wij≠0, and Lij=+∞ if wij=0. Then define the sum of the lengths

of edges as the weighted path in this path, and the distance Lij between i and j is the shortest path

Journal Pre-proof between these two vertices. The weight path length of the entire graph is the mean distance between
all possible pairs of vertices,

LW =

1

∑ ∑ (1 N ( N − 1)) N L N −1

i =1

j ≠i ij

(3)

This definition can solve the problem that disconnected edges have infinite path lengths

(Ahamdlou and Adeli,2011;Ahmadlou, Adeli and Adeli, 2010), i.e., 1/∞→0.

2.7. Empathy Index and Statistical Analyses

Previous neuroimaging studies about empathy shows that painful pictures induced increased activation in ACC and the right middle frontal gyrus (Gu and Han, 2007). This activation state of different brain regions can also be represented through the changes of network topology. EEG based studies also indicated that ERP is a good tool to present temporal dynamics of pain empathy. In this study, we constructed the functional connectivity of early and late ERP responses respectively. In

order to characterize the neural activities of pain empathic though the functional brain connectivity

quantitatively, we proposed an empathy index based on the characteristic parameters of the

connectivity networks from the responses of early and later ERPs. Based on the network parameters

C, L and MI value discussed above, the empathy index (EI ) is defined as,

EI

=

(C22

+

MI

2 2

)

L2

(4)

(C12 + MI12 )L1

Where C1, L1, MI1 is the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and mutual information

of the network from early ERP components, respectively. C2, L2, MI2 is the corresponding value

from late ERP’s. It is an index to quantify the empathy based on functional connectivity between

ERPs from the whole brain, in which we used the quantization parameters corresponding to early

and late ERP components. As the two basic measures used to characterize the local and global structure of the functional brain networks, C is used to represent the local structure of the network and L is used to represent the global characteristic. Besides, MI is a nonlinear measure of the interdependence between ERPs from different brain regions. Through the quantitative analysis of the above mentioned interdependent and networks, it can analyze humans’ empathic ability towards humans and robots objectively. In this paper we used EI to characterize human’s empathic ability to humans and robots quantitatively.
Journal Pre-proof As the variables discussed above were under different conditions for the same subject group.
Three-way repeated measure ANOVA (rmANOVA) for Pain × Model × Pre-Post interaction was implemented in SPSS to do the analysis of the network difference between early and later period. Two-way ANOVA analysis was implemented with the factors of Model (human vs. robot) and Pain (painful vs. non-painful) for the amplitude of P3, mutual information (MI), clustering coefficient (C), path lengths (L), and empathy index (EI) respectively. The statistical analysis was done across the averaged trials for each subject and Spearman correlations were performed to assess relationship among network features and subjects’ empathy scores.
3. Results
We got the event-related potentials induced by human and robot hands under painful and nonpainful condition. As depicted in Fig.3 is the ERP signal from Pz channel, which is the most common used electrode for ERPs. The P3 component based on the grand-averaged ERP of all subjects for each channel were analyzed. The mean amplitude was calculated from time window [310 500] ms as the P3 component, as done in previous studies (Suzuki, et al.,2015; Fan and Han, 2008; Li and Han, 2010).
As show in Fig.4, the amplitude of P3 was larger in painful stimuli than non-painful stimuli both for human hand and robot hand condition. The amplitude was larger for human hand stimuli than robot hand stimuli for the painful condition, but not for the non-painful condition. Results from the repeated measure ANOVA analysis showed a significant Model×Pain interaction (F(1,15)=15.6, p=0.001, η2=0.456). A significant main effects of Model was observed in the painful condition (F(1,15)=19.007, p<0.001, η2=0.522), but not for the non-painful condition (F(1,15) =0.075, p=0.787, η2=0.006), indicating that seeing human hand in pain induced a larger P3 amplitude than seeing robot hand in pain (Fig.4). The main effects of Pain was significant for human hand stimuli

(F(1,15)=37.03, p<0.001, η2=0.619) and robot hand stimuli (F(1,15)=4.952, p=0.034, η2=0.216), which suggests that robot painful stimuli induce larger P3 amplitude than robot non-painful stimuli, which is similar to the human condition.
Journal Pre-proof Fig.4. Grand averaged amplitude of P3 at Pz. Amplitude of P3 were larger in painful stimuli than non-painful
stimuli, both for human and robot hand. It was larger in human hand than robot hand in painful condition, but not in non-painful condition. Statistical analysis was done during the different situations, “*” mean p<0.05, “**” means p<0.01.
In order to investigate the connectivity features of painful empathy responses, the early network and late network which based on the mutual information for both early ERPs (N1 and N2) and late ERPs (Late P3) were constructed respectively. The corresponding MI matrix is depicted in Fig.5. It can be seen that the connection weights for the early component are larger than the late component, especially in frontal areas. No visual differences were observed between the Model and Pain condition, but the difference of the connectivity matrix between early and late network were significant. The mean value of each matrix was calculated, as depicted in Fig.6. The averaged MI value of both human hand stimuli and robot hand stimuli in non-painful condition were larger for the early component (MI1), indicating that in the early period, the non-painful stimuli induce stronger channel interdependence (mutual information) between different brain regions than other stimuli. The MI value for late component (MI2) in non-painful condition was the smallest one, however, the MI value for late components were almost the same between human hand stimuli and robot hand stimuli both for painful and non-painful condition. Overall, the MI value between signals from human hand stimuli was larger than robot hand stimuli.

Repeated measure ANOVA of Pain (painful vs. non-painful) × Model (human vs. robot) × Pre_Post (pre network vs post network) for averaged MI outcome found a significant interaction (F (1,45) =3.2, p=0.0049, η2=0.06). Post-hos analysis confirmed that MI value for pre network were significantly larger than late network both for human hand stimuli (painful: F(1,15)=3.5,p=0.041, η2=0.06; non-painful: F(1,15) =6.83, p=0.0181, η2=0.101) and robot hand stimuli (painful: F(1,15)=2.11,p=0.068, η2=0.008; non-painful: F(1,15)=6.18,p=0.0211, η2=0.248). Indicating that the MI based connectivity for early component was significantly stronger than late component both for human and robot hand stimuli. In other word, there were significant interaction of MI value between pre and post network both in painful (human: F(1,15)=3.5, p=0.041, η2=0.06; robot: F(1,15)=2.11,

p=0.068, η2=0.008) and non-painful (human: F(1,15)=6.83, p=0.0181, η2=0.101; robot: F(1,15)=6.18, p=0.0211, η2=0.248) condition. Indicating that the connectivity for early component was significantly stronger than late component both for painful and non_painful stimuli. Results of Model × Pain analyses found no significant interaction (MI1: F(1,15)=0.642, p=0.630, η2=0.018; MI2: F(1,15)=0.202, p=0.659, η2=0.011). The main effects of Model is not significant both in painful stimuli (MI1: F(1,15)=0.0000, p=0.9965, η2=0.001; MI2: F(1,15)=1.3601, p=0.2527, η2=0.063) and non-painful stimuli (MI1: F(1,15)=0.365, p=0.55, η2=0.019; MI2: F(1,15)=0.358, p=0.554, η2=.019).
Journal Pre-proof The main effects of Pain is significant both for human hand stimuli (F(1,15)=4.7986, p=0.0356,
η2=0.212) and robot hand stimuli for MI1 (F(1,15) = 4.583, p= 0.0496, η2=0.191), but not for MI2 (human stimuli: F(1,15)=1.2727, p=0.2681, η2=0.06; robot stimuli: F(1,15) = 1.1512, p=0.2283, η2=0.071). These results indicate that humans show empathy for a robotic hand in pain in similar ways as they show to a human hand in pain. The mutual information of the whole brain in the early component decreased during empathy response. But no significant changes of the MI value were observed in the late period.
In order to highlight the connection weights which exhibit sensitivity to empathy, we set a threshold to each network (T1=0.41 for early component and T2=0.2 for late component). The value which smaller than the threshold was set as 0 and retain the value which was larger. As there is no unique way to choose threshold T (Rosentha-von der Putten et al.,2013;Suzuki et al.,2009), we explored a whole range T values from 0.1 to 0.56, with a increment of 0.01 and repeated the full analysis for each value of the threshold T. Stam (Stam et al.,2007) got the threshold value through the statistical analysis of C and L between different groups. Similar to their work, the average was done over the individual values of C/L as a function of the T, as shown in Fig.7. The results might be influenced by the differences of the averaged interdependencies between different groups. In order to get the appropriate T, statistical analysis was done between HP and HNP group, as Ref.1 indicated that the brain activities between painful stimuli and non-painful stimuli for human hand have the most significant difference. The most significant difference is found at T1=0.41 (t=2.964, p=0.008) and T2=0.2 (t=2.938, p=0.012).

Journal Pre-proof late network. Black pentagrams indicate where the difference between the HNP and HP group is significant (t-test,
p<0.05).
It can be seen from Fig.8 that after the threshold selection, the weighted network topological structure differs between the early network and the late network. Early ERP connectivity was mainly located in frontal-parietal areas, whereas late ERP network reflects the connectivity in occipitoparietal areas. Compared with the weight value of early network, the weight value for late network was smaller，it is necessary to calculate the network parameters and to do the quantitative analysis.
Fig.8. Weighted topographic network under different conditions for early and late ERP component corresponding to Fig.5.
The C and L of the network corresponding to Fig.8 are shown in Fig.9. Statistical analysis revealed that the Model × Pain interaction was not significant both for C and L regardless of the early network (C: F(1,15)=0.007, p=0.934, η2=0.001; L: F(1,15)=0.742, p=0.402, η2=0.031) and late network (C: F(1,15)=0.250, p=0.624, η2=0.021; L: F(1,15)=0.006, p=0.941, η2=0.001). The simple main effects of Model of painful stimuli is significant for both C and L in the early component and late component (C1: F(1,15)=5.535, p=0.0334, η2=0.219; L1: F(1,15)=4.968, p=0.041, η2=0.201; C2:

F(1,15)=4.835, p=0.0357, η2=0.212; L2: F(1,15)= 5.136, p=0.0309, η2=0.231), but the simple main effects of Model of non-painful stimuli is not significant for both C and L (C1: F(1,15)=0.532, p=0.4714, η2=0.026; L1: F(1,15)=0.007, p=0.933, η2=0.001; C2: F(1,15)=0.1343, p=0.7165, η2=0.003; L2: F(1,15)=1.6952, p=0.2028, η2=0.076). These results indicate that the network parameters can reflect differential responses of empathy towards humans and robots, and that empathy to humans shows stronger connectivity than that towards robots. The simple main effects of Pain of humans for both C and L is significant (C1: F(1,15)=6.896, p=0.0291, η2=0.239; L1:
Journal Pre-proof F(1,15)=7.273, p=0.017, η2=0.306). Significant main effects of Pain for robot condition was
observed only for L1 (F(1,15)=4.693, p=0.0383, η2=0.207), but not for C1 (F(1,15)=0.884, p=0.3547, η2=0.041). The simple main effects of Pain is not significant both for C2 (Human: F(1,15)=3.665, p=0.0651, η2=0.176; robot: F(1,15)=0.9062, p=0.3487, η2=0.049) and L2 (Human: F(1,15)=0.2134, p=0.6473, η2=0.011; robot: F(1,15)=0.2190, p=0.6431, η2=0.011). From the functional connectivity perspective, these findings also indicate that humans show weaker empathy responses to robot hands condition compared to human hands in pain.

In order to comprehensively measure pain empathy towards humans and robots through functional network metrics, empathy index (EI) was calculated for different conditions. As shown in Fig.10 that EI under painful stimuli is higher than non-painful stimuli both for human and robot hand conditions. The EI value is almost the same for non-painful stimuli both for human and robot hands, but is higher for painful stimuli to human hand compared to robot hand, indicating that empathy index is a reliable measurement which can be used to characterize the empathic ability of humans and it is more comprehensive than network parameters.

different situations, “*” means p<0.05.
Statistical analysis shows the interaction of Model × Pain is not significant (F(1,15)=0.278, p=0.606, η2=0.031). The simple main effects of Model for painful stimuli is significant (F(1,15)=6.653, p=0.0113, η2=0.331), but not significant for non-painful stimuli (F(1,15)=0.031, p=0.862, η2=0.002). The simple main effects of Pain for both human and robot conditions are significant (human: F(1,15)=6.869, p=0.0136, η2=0.321; robot: F(1,15)=4.432, p=0.0412, η2=0.201), indicating humans empathize to both humans and robots in painful condition. These results also indicate that there is a larger empathy response to human hands than to robot hands in pain, but no differences are found for non-painful stimuli for either condition. It also supports the view that painful stimuli can induce empathy towards robots.
One week before the experiment, the subjects completed a series of self-reported dispositional measures, including the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Interpersonal Reaction Index (IRI). Following the experiment, subjects were asked to rate pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to these photos with the same visual dynamic situations which they had seen in the computer screen during the test by using a scale from no pain (0) to extreme pain (10) and no effect (0) to extreme unpleasantness (10). As pain stimuli may induce other emotional reactions except empathy, such as fear, disgust, and distress. We also asked subject to do an emotional reaction questionnaire after they finish the UNPL and PAIN test, as shown in Table1. Correlation analysis between these dispositional measures and network parameters and empathy index were accomplished, and we did not find any significance correlations.

4. Discussion
Journal Pre-proof In development psychology, empathy is defined as an affective response stems from the
understanding of other’s emotional state or condition similar to what the other person is feeling in the given situation (Decety and Lamm,2006; Decety,2010; Decety and Meyer 2008). It allows us to understand others’ feelings and emotions even though we have not experienced the same situations. Previous studies have indicated that pain is a window through which we can obtain a detailed view of the cognitive and neurophysiological mechanism underlying the process of empathy (Suzuki et al., 2015;Decety and Lamm,2006; Decety,2010; Decety and Meyer, 2008). Decety and Lamm’s model indicated that empathy involves both early emotion sharing (bottom-up process) and late executive control (top-down process) to regulate and modulate this experience (Suzuki et al., 2015; Decety and Lamm,2006). Recent ERP studies have indicated that early bottom up and late top-down stages of processing for other’s pain wherein the early components (N1, N2) is considered to be a marker of bottom-up attention of the early sharing process, and P3 and LPC is considered to be a marker of top-down attention of the late modulate process (Suzuki et al.,2015; Meng, Jackson and Chen,2013; Fan and Han, 2008; Cheng, Chen and Decety, 2014). Compared with non-painful

pictures, painful stimuli elicited a more positive shift to the ERP components. Thus, ERP is a good

tool to investigate the temporal factors of pain empathy (Suzuki et al., 2015; Cheng, Chen and

Decety, 2014; Han, Fan and Mao, 2008).

In this study, we investigated whether subjects can display empathy to robots in painful vs. non-

painful conditions using an ERP based functional connectivity analysis. Not only the ERP signals

were detected and compared in this article, but also the parameters of the functional networks were

analysis and compared between the painful stimuli and non-painful stimuli both for human hands

and robot hands. Our results found P3 responses were greater for painful than non-painful stimuli

both for human hands and robot hands, which is consistent with recent literatures (Suzuki et al.,

2015;Fan and Han,2008), in which numerous studies on emotion for pain have suggested painful stimuli induced strong empathic response (Suzuki et al., 2015; Han, Fan and Mao, 2008; Cui, Ma and Luo,2016;Cheng,Chen and Decety,2014). We also found larger amplitude for human hand stimuli than robot hand stimuli for the pain condition, but not for the non-pain condition. Mainly because the robot hand is a bit simplified and some subjects did not perceive it as a humanoid hand. This result indicates that the top-down controlled processes of empathy for pain is influenced by visual sensory gain control of the humans. Supported the model of Decety and Lamm that humans
Journal Pre-proof may react towards robots as they do to humans (Rosenthal-von der Pütten et al.,2013; Nass et
al.,1997), however, the neural activities in human brain was different to pain stimuli for robots and humans.
The two-level model of human empathy has displayed different neural mechanism and responses for the processing of empathy (Suzuki et al., 2015; Decety and Lamm, 2006; Decety,2010; Decety and Meyer,2008). These distinct states of neural activity are associated with various temporal characteristics of these EEG potentials that can be quantified using interdependence measures (Ahmadlou and Adeli,2011; Press, Gillmeister and Heyes, 2006). Mutual information can represent linear and nonlinear statistical dependencies between time series and is used to assess information transmission and dynamical coupling among different cortical areas in empathy process. This association suggests that EEG activity can reflect differential information processing for the two levels of human empathy process (Suzuki et al,2009; Jeong, Gore and Peterson,2001; Yin et al.,2016).
In this study, we found that MI value of the early network is larger than late network’s. We presume that executive cognitive control processing requires more information exchange between brain areas during the empathic concern than the emotion sharing process. The MI value is almost the same in the two process levels for the painful stimuli, but for later control it is significant less than earlier sharing to the non-painful stimuli, indicating the neural activities of painful stimuli were activated in both emotion sharing and executive control process. There are more mutual information exchanges between different brain areas involved in empathy. For non-painful stimuli, the information exchange is localized in the earlier level. Evidence from cognitive and development neuroscience has shown that the development of emotion share is strongly associated with several core executive control (Fu and Wang, 2014; Tottenham, Hare and Casey,2011; Schmeichel and

Tang,2015), which suggests that the processing of empathy is modulated by executive control. Our findings supported this claim. We also observed larger MI value of the human hand stimuli than to robot hand. This is consistent with several previous behavioral studies which show human actions elicit more automatic activation than observation of robotic actions (Press, Gillmeister and Heyes, 2006).
The topological structure of the brain showed that functional connectivity differs between the earlier and later level. This is likely due to the differing patterns of neural activities and information
Journal Pre-proof exchange between the subareas in the early and late levels. Previous fMRI studies have showed
enhanced activation of neural circuits in ACC, insula and frontal cortex in response to empathy of pain (Botvinick et al.,2005; Cheng et al.,2007; Gu and Han,2007). These studies show increased connectivity in frontal-parietal areas for earlier level, whereas more activation at the occipito-parietal areas was found for the late level. Due to the high spatial resolution of fMRI, it is easy to localize areas involved in empathy, but the advantages of EEG is that it possesses high temporal resolution capable of reflecting the information exchanges during empathy which may be characterized with different time courses (Botvinick et al.,2005; Gu and Han, 2007).
Clustering coefficient is an index of local connectivity, and the high clustering of the network is associated with its robustness which is resilience against random network damage. The path length is a characteristic of global connectivity and indicates how easily information is transmitted within the network (Rubinov and Sporns,2010). It can be seen from Fig.9 that the C value is larger for human hand stimuli than for robot hand stimuli in the earlier level for both pain and non-pain conditions, indicating greater local structure in the network, whereas the opposite is observed in the later level. The L is almost no change between Model in the early network, but it is smaller for the robot hand stimuli than for human hand stimuli in the late network, which suggests more information transmission occurred in the late network for human hand stimuli. This is consistent with the research of Press (Press et al.,2005). Our results also showed that the local connectivity of the nonpainful stimuli is greater than to the painful stimuli in the early network, while the opposite was observed for the late network. In addition, the global connectivity of early network in the pain condition was larger than the non-pain condition, with almost no change in the late network.
Empathy index was defined based on several parameters of the network and appears to be a reliable index to characterize human empathic based on our results. Ratings of Pain Intensity and

Unpleasantness ratings showed similar results as previous studies did (Suzuki, et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2006; Meng, Jackson and Chen,2013; Decety, Yang and Cheng,2010). As expected, pain ratings were higher than non-pain ratings for both human and robot hands, and pain ratings for human hands were higher than for robot hands. However, there were no significant statistical differences between these conditions. We got a normal result for emotional reaction questionnaires that subjects show higher emotion reaction value to human pain condition than non-pain condition, and higher value to human pain condition than robot pain condition. But still we did not find any
Journal Pre-proof significant correlations between the emotional reactions and the network parameters. This could be
due to the fact that the ratings were subjective measures, whereas the EEG recording provided a more objective measure and it is more reliably.
To date, few quantitative studies investigating empathy processes can be found in the literatures, as most publications investigate empathy in a qualitative manner. This study is the first attempt to construct a functional connectivity network for pain empathy using EEGs. Besides, the network parameters and empathy index were calculated and defined to perform quantitative analysis of empathy reactions to humans vs. robots in painful and non-painful condition. This analysis provides a good tool to characterize the neural processes involved in empathy.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides the first functional connectivity evidence of humans’ ability to pain empathy towards humans and robots, and the differences were highlighted. We investigated the effects of visual appearance of humans and robots on ERPs induced by empathy for pain. Connectivity networks for early and late ERP components from the whole brain during empathy processes were constructed. Based on the network parameters, an empathy index was proposed to quantify the empathic ability of humans.
We found that the mutual dependence of ERPs during early emotion sharing process was decreased in painful situation both for human and robot hands stimuli, but the changes in late cognitive evaluation process were not distinct. Besides, the mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli in early process. The functional connectivity found that the early process has larger weight value compared to the late process. Quantitative analysis indicated network parameters can represent human’s empathic ability and EI is a good index to characterize empathy. The results indicate EI value was higher in painful condition compared with

non-painful condition both for human and robot hands stimuli, and the value was higher for human
than for robot in painful condition, but no significant differences were found in non-painful
condition.
Taken together, this study firstly provides the functional connectivity features of neural activities
both for early and late stages of empathic responses for humans and robots. It is also certified that
the empathy index can be used to characterize the empathic ability of humans efficiently.
