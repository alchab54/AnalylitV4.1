Abstract

To assess the views of opiate-dependent individuals about supervised methadone consumption. Three groups of opinions were sought: (i) new patients referred for assessment and treatment, using rating scales; (ii) the consensus view of the Methadone Alliance (a national users’ forum); and (iii) the consensus view of a local service users’ forum. All three groups expressed the view that supervised consumption has an important place in methadone treatments. Users understand the need for daily supervision of methadone and are generally willing to accept it. Users’ views provide support for the introduction of flexible methadone prescribing regimes incorporating supervised consumption. Privacy in pharmacies and the possibility of moving away from supervision are important elements in an acceptable programme. Supervised consumption is an important component of safe, effective and responsible methadone prescribing.
