Abstract
Background: Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the evidence base supporting the efficacy of video consultations (VC) in mental health services. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has also demonstrated the potential of virtual treatment. Despite these promising results and conducive conditions for VC, several studies have highlighted that the uptake and implementation of VC continues to be slow, even post-pandemic. In order to facilitate and strengthen the implementation of VC and exploit its potential as a useful tool for mental health disorder treatment, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the issues and experiences of implementing and using VC as a treatment modality in clinical practice.
Objective: To investigate patients' and clinicians' experiences and attitudes toward using VC in clinical practice.
Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients (n=10) and clinicians (n=4) who participated in weekly virtual treatment over two months within a mental health outpatients services in Denmark. Data from these semi-structured interviews with patients and focus group interviews with clinicians were explored through thematic analysis.
Results: Common themes constructed from the patient interviews yielded two main themes; (1) Adjusting to the practicality of the VC format and (2) The practice of therapy using VC. Patients experienced that using VC was easy and convenient, increased their treatment engagement, and helped establish and maintain a therapeutic alliance. The thematic analysis conducted on clinicians' experience with VC yielded three themes; (1) A change of mindset from resistance to one of acceptance, (2) The contact is different on video, and (3) A new way of working. Clinicians experienced their initial concerns and resistance towards VC implementation gradually diminishing, and gaining clinical experience using VC is a prerequisite for a successful VC implementation in mental health services.
Conclusions: Both patients and clinicians experienced that VC enhanced access to treatment and could be meaningfully integrated into clinical practice. This study also found clinicians expressed initial concerns and some resistance towards VC, but this diminished with the utilization of VC. Future research is needed to facilitate clinicians' use of VC in clinical practice.

the implementation of VC and exploit its potential as a useful tool for mental health disorder
treatment, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the issues and experiences of implementing
and using VC as a treatment modality in clinical practice.
Objective: To investigate patients' and clinicians' experiences and attitudes toward using VC in
clinical practice.
Methods: Semi structured interviews were conducted individually with patients (n=10) and in a
focus group with clinicians (n=4). Both groups had participated in weekly VC treatment over two
months within a mental health outpatients services in Denmark. Data from these semi-structured
interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results: Common themes constructed from the patient interviews yielded two main themes; (1)
Adjusting to the practicality of the VC format and (2) The practice of therapy using VC. Patients
experienced that using VC was easy and convenient, and it was possible to establish and maintain a
therapeutic alliance. They also described the contact as different to in-person therapy.
The thematic analysis conducted on clinicians' experience with VC yielded three themes; (1) A
change of mindset from resistance to one of acceptance, (2) The contact is different on video, and (3)
A new way of working. Clinicians experienced their initial concerns and resistance towards VC
implementation gradually diminished over time as they gained clinical experience using the
modality. They expressed contact with patients can be different and it took time to adjust to new way
of working therapeutically.
Conclusions: Both patients and clinicians experienced that VC could enhance access to treatment
and be meaningfully integrated into clinical practice. Additionally, both groups described the contact
over VC was different to in-person therapy. Future research could examine patients and clinicians
perceived differences of contact using the VC modality and the implications for therapeutic
interventions.
Introduction
It is estimated that around 970 million (13%) people globally have a mental health disorder (pre
pandemic 2019), and most of these people do not have access to an effective mental health
services[1]. Mental health services is challenged worldwide by the disparity between the limited
number of mental health practitioners and the increasing number of patients needing mental health
assessment or treatment [2]. With the growing aging of western population and digitalization of
people's behavior, communication, and lifestyle, there is a need for user-friendly and meaningful
technological solutions that can adapt to these changes [1,2].
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
Over the last decade, researchers worldwide have investigated video consultation (VC) as an
alternative mental health treatment modality, especially for rural patients. Qualitative studies have
shown that VC can increase access to care not only for patients who live in rural areas but also for
patients who have problems with mobility, access to transport, or economical limitations [3–8]. For
patients with a busy daily life, e.g., due to work and school or conflicting schedules, VC can also be
a preferred treatment modality, as it can offer the convenience and flexibility in the provision of
mental health treatment [7]. It has also been reported that VC can reduce stigmatization as patients
do not need to leave their homes for mental health services encounters [8]. Similar to the positive
experiences reported in qualitative studies evaluating VC, quantitative studies have also reported that
mental health services delivered via VC is equivalent to in-person consultation [9–12].
Despite the growing body of evidence indicating equivalence between VC and in-person
consultation, there are also several barriers and concerns to the implementation of VC in clinical
practice. These barriers can generally be divided into three categories; (1) the technology itself, (2)
characteristics of the (end-) users of the technology, and (3) the context in which technology is
implemented.
Firstly, barriers related to the technology and VC in particular, involve concerns about the user
friendliness (easiness) of the technology, the accessibility of the technology, confidentiality, and the
security features (such as encryptions, logins and authentications, software updates, etc.) [13–15].
Secondly, barriers linked to the users of the technology (patients and clinicians) include, for example,
the users' physical and mental state when using the technology, the users' experience and
technological skills in using the technology (digital competency), and the users' transition phase from
in-person to VC modality. In addition, using VC in clinical practice, particularly for therapeutic
interventions requires establishing a virtual therapeutic alliance, which can be experienced as new
and challenging for some users [15,16]. Thirdly, barriers related to the user context include whether
VC is used for general assessment, diagnosis, or treatment and the physical settings/environments
where VC is implemented, e.g., at the patient's/clinician's home, in a hospital, or in an outpatient
service [17–19]. Finally, the medical tech industry is under constant development, and new
technological tools or improvements to existing systems are regularly introduced to the healthcare
systems [20,21]. This potentially leads to a demand from both patients and clinicians to access and
use cutting-edge technology in clinical practice but also requires ongoing training of users and an
adjustment of clinical workflows to accommodate this new development.

Understanding the interactions between humans and technology is an important
factor in determining how a digital solution will be received and utilized in
clinical practice. Technology acceptance is defined as an individuals intentional or
voluntary use of a technology and is a core aspect in understanding the utilization
of technology in the real world [22]. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
describes how perceived usefulness and ease of use of a technology impacts on
attitudes, behavioral intention to use (intention) and actual use [23,24]. This
theoretical framework can be used to understand how the attitudes and
experiences of users (eg: clinicians and patients) may impact on the use of VC
within clinical practice. Several reviews have shown that the TAM is a valid
model to explain the utilization of technology in health settings [25]. This study
explored patient and clinician experiences when using VC to provide insight into
the factors that may impact on its uptake or utilization in clinical practice.
Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate patients' and clinicians' experiences and attitudes
toward using VC in clinical practice. Understanding patients (service user) and clinicians’ (service
provider) perspectives is a key factor to the successful implementation of VC in treatment.
Developing a deeper understanding of the experience of users working with VC could help generate
ideas to facilitate and strengthen the implementation of VC and exploit its full potential as a tool for
treatment of mental health disorders.
Methods
Study Design
A qualitative study design with an exploratory approach was utilized to investigate the experiences of
patients and clinicians in using VC in clinical practice. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
Qualitative (COREQ) research guidelines were followed to report this study [26]. COREQ is a set of
guidelines that aim to enhance the transparency of conducting and reporting qualitative research.
It incorporates various aspects of the study, including study design and procedure, data collection and
analysis, and reporting the study in a structured manner. This qualitative study was part of a larger
study which collected quantitative data about how clinicians utilized VC in clinical practice and the
results have been published elsewhere [25]
Settings and Participants
The study was conducted in a mental health outpatient service in the southern part of region Zealand,
Denmark. The clinic treats around 550 adult patients (>18 years) annually with anxiety, post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and personality disorders, both individually or group
based. Nearly 50% of the patients are between 18 and 29 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
recommendations from the health government were to carry out VC with patients, but in-person
consultation was still an option for patients. The VC system was available before the pandemic but
not utilized sufficiently in clinical practice.
A convenience sample of patients and clinicians that utilized VC in the treatment of non-psychotic
disorders were invited to participate in interviews. Participants were recruited from an
implementation study conducted at the same clinical site which collected data on a range of
quantitative outcomes such as acceptance, demand, negative outcomes and reported focus for
therapists for patients receiving treatment via VC (n=15) or in person treatment (n=19). A detailed
description of the design and results of this study is contained in another publication [27].
Patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were over 18 years old, were newly
diagnosed with a non-psychotic disorder, and owned a smartphone or computer with the option of
VC. Clinicians had an allied health background (e.g., psychologist, psychiatric nurse, or psychiatrist)
and therapeutic education in cognitive behavioral therapy, mentalization-based therapy, schema
focused therapy, or dialectical behavioral therapy, and a minimum of one year of clinical/therapeutic
experience.
Video consultations
Patients received the diagnosis-specific treatment based on their needs, and treatment were
conducted virtually through VC modality. This treatment typically consisted of 8 weekly sessions
over a period of two months and usually included a combination of psychoeducation, psychotherapy,
support, and medication. Psychotherapy had a focus of promoting a better understanding of
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
difficulties experienced, possible triggers and the development of appropriate strategies to deal with
these difficulties. Patients receiving treatment via VC had indicated that they were open to
participating in treatment via this modality. The participants (patients and clinicians) in the study had
little or no in-person interactions prior to commencing treatment via VC.
Procedure
Patients and clinicians who had participated in the two-month treatment course via VC were invited
to participate in interviews. The interviews in the study included individual semi-structured
interviews with the patients and a focus group interview with the clinicians. An interview guide [28]
was developed to facilitate the semi-structured interviews with the patients, while a discussion guide
[29] was developed for the focus group interview with the clinicians. Both guides consisted of open
ended questions and probes in order to cover the important aspects of utilizing VC in clinical
practice. The guides were developed by researchers with experience in telemedicine research. The
guides included (1) an introduction section that clarified the purpose of the interviews, followed by
(2) general questions related to the experience of using VC, (3) questions regarding the use of VC in
for clinical treatment , (4) probes regarding any perceived differences between VC and in-person
consultation and (5) probes regarding suggestions for changes/improvements regarding the use of
VC in clinical practice 6) question about other experiences and reflections about VC not already
covered in the interview. The researcher conducting the interviews had no prior working relationship
with the participants.
The semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually or in-person at the patients' homes or the
mental health outpatient service. The interviews took place after patients had completed the VC
therapy course (eight video appointments). Patients were asked open-ended and probing questions,
and the interviewer (AAS) was aware and reflective of his own beliefs regarding VC. The interview
guide was designed to allow participants have the necessary time to elaborate on their own
perceptions of VC for each of the topics covered in the interview guide. The interviews ranged from
15 to 45 minutes and were audio recorded.
The focus group interview was held in the mental health outpatient service at the end of the study,
where the clinicians (psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and psychologists) had their daily clinical
work. The first author (AAS) mediated the focus group interview and facilitated discussion and
dialogues between participants while keeping the focus group interview on track. The interview
lasted one hour and were audio recorded.
Data Analyses
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
The study took an inductive approach to collect information about patient and clinician experiences
using VC as a treatment modality. Thematic analysis was used as a methodology to analyze the data
generated during the interviews which followed guidelines outlined by Braun & Clarke [30]. The
analysis aimed at identifying broader patterns of latent meanings by transcending the descriptive
level of the data. A guiding principle was the “keyness” of theme in regards to its ability to capture
important information to the research focus [30,31].
The analytic procedure entailed (1) becoming familiar with the data which involved reading and re
reading the data set and writing memos, (2) generating initial codes, where data was labelled and
organized into meaningful groups. Codes were organized around central ideas or concepts (3)
searching for themes; defining different theme properties (4) reviewing tentative themes: collapsing
overlapping themes, reworking and refining codes and themes (5) labeling themes: fitting the broader
data set to respond to the research questions and (6) summarizing the data. The themes were
conceptualized as patterns of shared meaning, cohering around a central concept – the central idea or
meaning.
The primary author (AAS) who was a qualified IT engineer and medical doctor conducted the
thematic analysis in consultation with the last author (SFA) to help construct codes and themes
through an iterative process. The second author (KT) an expert in qualitative analysis provided
overall guidance and supervision of the analysis. Two separate thematic analyses were conducted,
one covering the patients' perspective and other the clinicians' perspectives of using VC in clinical
practice.
The thematic analysis emphasized the importance of the researcher’s subjectivity as analytic
resource, and their reflexive engagement with theory, data and interpretation. Different strategies
were used to increase the trustworthiness and promote reflexivity during the analysis [32,33]. Firstly,
all interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and uploaded to a secure central archive so that
all coders could have prolonged engagement with the raw data and thereby improve the credibility of
the analysis. Second, raw data were transferred to NVivo 12 Pro so that each step of the analysis
could be documented. This created an audit trail and promoted confirmability. Thirdly, the two
researchers (AS & SFA), who conducted the thematic analysis engaged in peer consultation to
promote triangulation regarding the main themes. Furthermore, a third author (KT) was consulted in
the peer consultation to clarify themes that could not be resolved between the two main authors.
Finally, results from the thematic analysis was presented to the entire research team and their
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
reflections and ideas were incorporated into the analysis where it was deemed appropriate.
Ethics
All participants received verbal and written information about the research project prior to informed
consent to their participation. All material from the interviews was anonymized and stored on a
secure server. Approval for the study was obtained from Denmark Ethics Committee, Zealand
(EMN-2021-00019) and from institutional review board (REG-003-2021).
Results
A total of 10 patients that received treatment via VC were interviewed. Participants had an age range
between 18-40 years (mode 29 years), were predominantly female (7 out of 10) and either had a
diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (n=5) or a borderline personality disorder (n=5). Patients that that
participated in the semi-structured interviews were considered representative of the typical referrals
to the clinic as over 80% invited into the study agreed to participate.
The thematic analysis conducted based on the ten semi-structured interviews yielded two themes
(Figure 1); (1) Adjusting to the practicalities of VC format and (2) The practice of therapy using VC.

JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
practical aspects concerning treatment conducted through VC. The theme's focus was generally
characterized by the patients' experiences and descriptions, outlining that VC is a practical tool
where they could participate in psychiatric treatment without interfering with their daily lives and
routines. VC was perceived as particularly advantageous for patients who have a busy everyday life
with school and work. . Some patients expressed that they probably would have to cancel their
treatment appointments if VC were not an option:
Well, I don't think we could have appointments that often. Especially because my school
schedule is fluctuating, so it's quite possible that I'll have to cancel an appointment or
two. Or many [P1].
The theme covered other positive aspects from participants such as reduced travel time, related travel
costs, and stress. The patients experienced that they could sit at home without spending time on
practical preparations for treatment, i.e., transportation, getting dressed, and taking time off from
school. VC was experienced as a valuable and stress-reducing treatment modality, which eliminates all
these "unnecessary" preparations and practicalities.
I think it has saved me a lot. I don't have to spend a lot of energy on traveling back and
forth. And during the weeks when it has been tough and I've been extra tired, I could
just do it over video, so in many ways, it has made it easier to do it over video. There
were often times when I thought, "I have a meeting tomorrow," ah, it is nice that it's
just over video. [P7]
Both quotes highlight the perceived advantage of VC by patients as the treatment modality allowed
greater flexibility which reflected the demands of everyday life. Participants described this
flexibility as promoting attendance
However, the patients also described that they sometimes experienced technical challenges
associated with the VC technology. These challenges were generally related to poor sound and image
quality. These practical experiences related to the technology were not to such an extent that they
affected the overall positive patient experience regarding using VC in clinical practice. When
technical challenges arose during the appointments, the patients and clinicians tried to collaborate to
solve the technical issues.
Well, you know, it's fantastic when it works. But the problems lie with the equipment the
government has purchased. It's caused clinicians to make some phone calls. Three
times she (clinician) sounded like a mouse. Ha ha. Then we figured out that I needed to
switch devices. I also have a tablet. And it was the same issue there. Then she switched
to a computer, and it worked. I mean, I have to say, what I had was so poor. Um, what's
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
it called. Having a headset helped a lot. What they're using doesn't work optimally, but
they still use it. But the headset works just fine. [P5]
This quotation highlights how relatively small technical issues could impact on the quality of
communication over VC and the need for both parties to be tolerate and flexible in finding a
solution.
Theme 2: The practice of therapy using VC
The second theme that was constructed from patient interviews covered how the patients experienced
VC affected establishing and maintaining therapeutic engagement and alliance. The patients
expressed that they were less affected by their anxiety symptoms when the appointment was
conducted virtually, making it easier to relax and establish or maintain engagement in therapy.
But it's also because I have no opportunity, I mean, regarding my anxiety, to go
anywhere because it's so severe. So I think it was really good that they could do this
video thing. Otherwise, I wouldn't have received any treatment. [P3]
The patients also experienced that VC contributed to reducing stigma as it promoted access to
psychiatric treatment giving them the possibility talk about the mental health problems with a
therapist. The ability to access treatment was seen as the first step to establish meaningful
engagement with psychiatric services.
Well, also the fact that I could have the option to do it over video meant a lot to me, actually, because
in the beginning, I was incredibly anxious about going to the psychiatric facility. I immediately
thought I would be locked up and had all sorts of anxious thoughts. So I was really grateful for the
opportunity to do it over video. [P2]
Both of these quotations describe how treatment via VC modality was perceived to promote
engagement in treatment by reducing anxiety when compared to face to face treatment.
Regarding the therapeutic alliance, participants expressed that it could be established and maintained
when treatment was conducted virtually. However, this alliance or contact with therapist was
considered different and for some participants was not considered to be at the same level as in person
therapy. This experience is reflected by one patient in the following quote:
If we see it as a spectrum, then what's it called, being there in person would be 100%
and video would be like 60-75%. But sometimes you need that 100% of being
physically present. You can look at each other and see that she's there, but it's not the
same as sitting in the same room. [P6]
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
Additionally, whilst patients described therapeutic alliance can be maintained sufficiently over video,
there were also some challenges. These challenges to therapeutic alliance were often described when
patients experienced powerful emotions or when dealing with complex and
Yes, that's if I were to become very emotional, if I were to get very upset. In those
moments, it would have been nice to have someone in-person to meet with. Because I
know that if I start having anxiety attacks, I need someone to put their hand on my
shoulder and give me a hug, which can't really be done through a video consultation.
[P7]
Whilst patients acknowledged that meaningful alliance could be achieved over VC, it was perceived
to have a different quality. Additionally, contact via VC modality was described as insufficient when
patients experienced extreme emotions and wanted some physical comforting.
In summary, the patients experienced VC as a convenient tool, which could easily be integrated into
their daily lives. The convenience of using the technology facilitated and contributed to increased
engagement with the treatment, even though the participants also from experienced a difference in
contact of VC compared to in-person therapy.
Clinicians ́ focus group interview
Four clinicians, three nurses and one psychologist, participated in the focus group interview and they
had an average of 10 years of experience treating patients with anxiety, depressive and personality
disorders using standard face to face treatment. Over the course of the study, each clinician
conducted on average twenty-six virtual consultations. Thus, these clinicians had gained experience
and familiarity with the video technology across several patient treatments.
The thematic analysis conducted based on the focus group yielded three themes (Figure 2); (1)

JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
Theme 1: Shifting from a mindset of resistance to one of acceptance
This theme was characterized by the clinicians experiencing a shift in their attitude toward using VC.
At the beginning of the study, the clinicians described a perceived resistance to using VC in clinical
practice; however, as they gained experience using VC, they developed a new and more nuanced
attitude around using VC in clinical practice. Clinicians described a range of several reasons for their
initial resistance. Firstly, the clinicians were worried that their professional identity would disappear
when the treatment took place over VC:
That it is just going to be robots, hahaha, and video, and there will be no human
interaction with the mentally vulnerable people, and I don't like that... but I had a
different experience along the way. [C1]
Secondly, the resistance was also associated with whether VC would technically work and whether
the clinicians possessed the technical skills to conduct VC:
I thought... phew, I'm not very tech-savvy... I didn't grow up with this technology, so I
found it a bit scary and a bit intimidating, but I also thought it was the future. [C4]
Thirdly, resistance was also associated with clinicians' worries that VC would be less effective for
the patients than in-person consultation:
I had a bit of a prejudice that there was a difference and that it would lean more towards
the advantage of in-person rather than video. That was my prejudice... I actually felt a
bit embarrassed about it. [C2]
However, over time the initial mindset of resistance shifted to a more accepting attitude, and worries
diminished as clinicians utilized VC in clinical practice, illustrated by the following quotes:
If I suggest video to the patients, they become ecstatically happy. Before this project, I
would never, ever suggested video instead. But I do now. I do it a lot now. My prejudices
have disappeared.
My attitude has absolutely changed. Now I know it, I have tried it, and it makes so much
sense for those patients who cannot leave their homes. [C3]
Clinicians initial concerns rooted in their professional identity, doubts about their technical
abilities and perceived effectiveness of treatment via VC was gradually changed from their
experiences using VC in clinical practice.
Theme 2: The contact is different when using video
The clinicians experienced that contact via VC is different compared to in-person contact. For
example, it was perceived that the contact via VC was artificial compared to in-person consultation,
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]

and clinicians compensated or tried to reduce this feeling of "artificiality" by creating new routines:
You could also say, "Have you had a cup of coffee over video" or "Are you going to get
yourself a cup of coffee" or "I'm going to go get myself a coffee now." But to make it less
artificial, you could say something like that. Or something else. Just to lighten it up for
myself, you know. [C2]
In addition, the clinicians felt that not all consultations were suitable to be conducted over video.
Clinicians were more reluctant to discuss sensitive and complex topics with the patient that may
induce emotional reactions:
Well... now I have many borderline patients, and I feel... it's not easy because there are a
lot of emotions involved. Sometimes they agree to video sessions. But then they say, "Oh,
we can't do it after all." So I think it depends a lot on the patient group. [C1]
The clinicians also felt that contact with patients with poor appointment adherence could be
strengthened by offering them VC rather than terminating the patients' affiliation with the clinic.
Also, if they cancel... then you can be cheeky. “Okay, what is it about? Should we change
it to video calls instead if it's better?” And there are some who say yes to that... So we
avoid some of those no-shows. [C3]
The quotations highlight that clinicians clearly experienced that contact was different and were creative
in new ways to build an alliance. Conversely they also voiced a concern about the ability to deal with
complex emotions when using VC.
Theme 3: Adapting to new way of working
This theme describes how the clinicians perceived VC as a new way of working and how VC can be
effectively integrated into a busy mental health outpatient service. The clinicians described that they
needed time, training, and experience with the technology before it could be implemented
successfully into clinical practice. The clinicians also recognized that introduction of VC as a tool
within treatment could produce some tension. However, clinicians described that being open and
transparent with the patients about the fact that VC is a new way of working was an important factor
in easing the implementation of VC in practice.
For many, VC is new, just like it is for us... so we have to address it... and maybe tell
that both of us (patients and clinicians) are tense in this situation. [C4]
The clinicians also described that the COVID-19 pandemic helped facilitate the implementation of
VC; it also caused stress, as they experienced that implementation took place too quickly. They
described that in the future a smoother transition at a more measured pace was necessary when new
technology was introduced into clinical practice. Nevertheless, participating in the study and gaining

experience with providing virtual treatment made the clinicians more confident in using VC in
clinical practice:
I feel more comfortable now than in the beginning. I am more comfortable... And I can
offer it to those who have difficulty leaving their homes. And I do it in an easier way than
before. [C2]
Overall, , clinicians initially experienced worries about whether VC could be used in clinical
practice. These perceived concerns faded as they became familiar with VC technology and adapted
to providing treatment using that modality in clinical settings. Clinicians described that there was a
need for a maturation period to build up further experience with VC before it could be integrated into
their daily working routines. Finally, there was a clear perception that contact was different using VC
and this could potentially have clinical implications such as a reluctance to work with complex
emotional states.
Discussion
This qualitative study investigated the patients' and clinicians' experience using VC in a mental
health outpatient service. Findings indicated that VC could be meaningfully integrated into mental
health services. Themes constructed from patient and clinician interviews highlighted various issues
that could impact the utility and acceptance of VC as a modality for providing mental health
treatment.
There were a number of commonalities across the themes for patients and clinicians. Firstly, from
both groups perceived that VC contributed to facilitating access to treatment. It facilitated accessing
and providing treatment, especially for patients with a busy everyday life with school and work and
those who cannot receive in-person treatment due to travel distance or being limited by their mental
health disorders. Ashwick and colleagues who investigated the use of VC for patients with PTSD in a
qualitative study. found that VC increased the patients' attendance and engagement with the virtual
treatment [7], consistent with this study. The authors also described that the patients experienced
"personal accountability" for maintaining attendance and engagement in the video treatment.
Additionally, patients experienced finding a private room without the presence of partners and
children could be challenging, and it was easier to postpone or not attend the virtual meeting at all if
they did not have the energy to participate in the VC. Patients from this study did not describe
“personal accountability” for VC although there were no PTSD patients were included in this study.
Scientific literature indicates that patients with PTSD can have a low treatment adherence, with 35
63% failing to complete a treatment course [34]. However, future studies should investigate how
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
virtual treatment engagement can be maintained and increased over time and space.
A second common theme for both patients and clinicians was the perceived contact was different in
VC compared to in-person consultation. Clinicians described a number of practical ways they
attempted to create this bond or good contact with their patients despite this perceived difference
with in person treatment. They also described different ways to make VC more "real or authentic"
and potentially compensate for the fact that treatment was being conducted over video. Examples of
these adjustments included asking patients virtually “if they have had a cup of coffee” at the start of a
session or suggest that patients have an object (eg: cushion or something they could hold onto) that
could help soothe them if they became upset. This "practice-orientated" mindset is an interesting
finding and could be seen as a compensatory behavior to treatment that is conducted virtually.
Both groups also described the perceived limitations of treatment or reservations of conducting
treatment over VC in relation to discussing complex or sensitive issues, which could trigger strong
emotional reactions. Several studies have reported similar findings that sensitive subjects arising
during psychotherapeutic treatment can be challenging to carry out over video and described VC as
superficial [13,17,18]. Interestingly, despite this perceived limitation with VC, many efficacy studies
show that VC is equal as in-person consultation [9–12]. Future studies should address how in-depth
consultations and complex subjects can be carried out virtually and which potential
(positive/negative) effects it yields in clinical practice.
Clinicians described an initial resistance to the use of VC for psychiatric treatment but this
diminished once they gained experience with using VC. This change in attitude from clinicians how
been found in a number of studies examining the implementation of VC [3,17]. Clinician attitudes
are central to the uptake of VC in clinical practice as they are seen as the “gatekeepers” whether
video consultations are offered to patients or not [16]. Thus, it is important that clinician experiences
with VC are made accessible to all clinicians when considering to use VC or not.
Patients largely experienced more positive views on VC compared to clinicians but they did describe
that technical issues could be disruptive when receiving treatment. Some patients experienced that
the screen froze and the sound was sometimes lacking. However, it was not a regular problem, and
did not affect the generally positive attitude toward using VC in clinical settings. This finding is
consistent with other studies showing that as long as the technical challenges are not persistent, they
are perceived as less significant by the patients [13,14].
Another common theme from clinicians was that the VC format introduced a new way of working
and significant change to their clinical practice. The VC implementation and uptake need maturation
time wherein clinicians can obtain routines and experience before it could become a permanent
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
practice in their clinical work. So even though the clinicians expressed that their mindset changed
from "resistance to acceptance", there is still a need for maturation from “accepting to implementing”
the technology in clinical practice. A recently published guide from WHO and a comprehensive
systematic review recommends several interventions to strengthen the video implementation,
including training and guidance for end users, technical support for end users, and continuous
evaluations and improvements in workflows and technical solutions related to the application of the
video system in the mental health care settings [35,36].
Using the Technology Acceptance Model TAM [23] to frame the experiences of patients and
clinicians on VC, there were a number of common themes which were consistent with aspects of
TAM covering the ease of use, perceived usefulness and acceptance of VC as a treatment modality
for mental health problems. Common themes that highlighted the advantages of VC (flexibility,
saving time and energy) could be seen as increasing acceptance and utilization whilst common
themes that concerned the limitations or challenges with VC (technical issues, difficulty discussing
such as complex emotions, concerns about adequate technology literacy) may reduce VC acceptance
and use in clinics.
Given that quantitative data about the utilization of VC in clinical practice was also collected from
these clinicians as part of another study [25], it was possible to explore the link between clinician
experiences collected from interviews with how VC was actually used in practice. Self-reported data
from these clinicians showed that VC was primarily used for a shorter time with a focus on
supportive counselling (80% of sessions) compared to in person sessions which were significantly
longer and had a much greater psychotherapy focus [25]. Thus, framing these outcomes using TAM
it is possible to hypothesize that clinician attitudes concerning the limited usefulness of VC when
used with complex emotional states directly impacted on the acceptance and use of VC in clinical
practice (eg: VC was primarily used for supportive counselling rather than psychotherapy).
Strength and Limitations
One of the strengths of the study is that it captured patients' and clinicians' perspectives on using VC
within the same mental health outpatient service. Analyzing experiences from treatment dyads
generated a more holistic understanding of the VC experience. Additionally, interviewing both
clinicians and patients, it allowed the exploration of commonalities and differences in the two user
perspectives. A second strength is the study is that included people with a range of mental health
disorders from a clinical setting which included a range of mental health professions. Thus, the
participants were considered representative of a clinical setting which may increase the ecological
https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/50580 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint]


JMIR Preprints Shaker et al
validity and generalizability of the results to other clinical settings. .
The study also had several limitations. Firstly, the study included a self-selected convenience sample,
consisting of participants who were willing to receive treatment via VC. This sample may be
considered biased or this group may have a more positive or open attitude to VC which in turn could
be reflected in the results. Secondly, the sample size for patients and clinicians was very small,
potentially limiting the generalizability of the results to the clinical setting. Additionally, the study
was conducted within a specific mental health outpatient service in Denmark which also limits the
generalizability of the findings to broader populations and different healthcare systems. Thirdly, a
deeper understanding of the clinicians' experiences might have been enhanced if individual semi
structured interviews had been conducted rather than focus group. Fourthly, experiences collected
were based on a relatively short intervention (2 months) making it difficult to understand experiences
with VC may develop or change over time. Fifthly, it is important to acknowledge that the primary
researchers’ (AAS) background and experience with VC may have influenced the interviews and
subsequent analysis of qualitative data. As thematic analysis involves the construction of themes
grounded in qualitative data, a range of strategies to promote trustworthiness in the analysis and
themes constructed were undertaken. Finally, the study was conducted during the COVID-19
pandemic which may have impacted on both patients and clinicians attitudes and behaviors regarding
VC.
Implications for Clinical Practice and Research
This study has several important practical implications. Firstly, results from the study show that VC
can be meaningfully implemented into mental health services and treatment via this modality can
contribute to establishing and maintaining a therapeutic engagement. This finding is especially
relevant for patients who, for various reasons, find it difficult to attend appointments in-person.
Secondly, this study has demonstrated that clinicians are accepting and open to utilizing VC in
clinical practice; however, this acceptance may take time to develop and may require maturation to
acquire experiences and skills to incorporate VC into clinical practice.
Interestingly, both patients and clinicians experienced that the contact via video differed from in
person contact and in some cases it was described as "superficial and artificial". Both groups
describe the perceived challenges of using VC in treatment with emotionally charged and complex
issues. Future studies need to investigate the impact of this perceived different contact in VC and its
implications for the application and adaptation of therapeutic techniques in psychiatric treatment.

Furthermore, one could move beyond the traditional understanding of VC and investigate how
cutting-edge technologies, such as AI, augmented, and virtual reality telepsychiatry can reduce the
“artificial experience” of VC and enhance telepresence, creating a new treatment environment where
complex treatment issues can be meaningfully explored.
Conclusions
From the patients' perspective, VC was a convenient tool that could be integrated into their daily
lives and promote treatment adherence. While clinicians experienced initial concerns and resistance
toward VC implementation, these reservations diminished over time as they gained clinical
experience using VC. Future studies could examine strategies to influence user attitudes and
acceptance of VC particularly regarding its perceived limitations which may directly impact on the
implementation and utilization of VC within mental health services.
