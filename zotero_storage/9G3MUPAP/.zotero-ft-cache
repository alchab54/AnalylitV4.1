Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to develop predictive models of three aspects of psycho
therapists' acceptance of telepsychotherapy (TPT) during the COVID-19 pandemic,
attitudes towards TPT technology, concerns about using TPT technology and inten
tion to use TPT technology in the future.
Method: Therapists (n = 795) responded to a survey about their TPT experiences
during the pandemic, including quality of the therapeutic relationship, professional
self-doubt, vicarious trauma and TPT acceptance. Regression decision tree machine
learning analyses were used to build prediction models for each of three aspects of
TPT acceptance in a training subset of the data and subsequently tested in the
remaining subset of the total sample.
Results: Attitudes towards TPT were most positive for therapists who reported a
neutral or strong online working alliance with their patients, especially if they experi
enced little professional self-doubt and were younger than 40 years old. Therapists
who were most concerned about TPT were those who reported higher levels of pro
fessional self-doubt, particularly if they also reported vicarious trauma experiences.
Therapists who reported low working alliance with their patients were least likely to
use TPT in the future. Performance metrics for the decision trees indicated that these
three models held up well in an out-of-sample dataset.
Conclusions: Therapists' professional self-doubt and the quality of their working alli
ance with their online patients appear to be the most pertinent factors associated
with therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during COVID-19 and should be
addressed in future training and research.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Providing psychotherapy remotely has multiple advantages, such as
providing access to patients in remote areas and with reduced mobil
ity, avoiding the stigma of visiting a mental health clinic and reduced
travel time and associated costs (e.g. commute and childcare; Békés,
Grondin, & Bouchard, 2020; Simpson, 2009). The COVID-19 pan
demic has created a unique context in which many therapists have
abruptly transitioned to telepsychotherapy (TPT), without much prep
aration or training in advance. Therapists' experience of this sudden
transition to a new therapy format might determine whether they will

lifted. It is therefore important to understand which therapist, patient
and treatment factors contribute to therapists' acceptance of the TPT
format and their intention to continue providing therapy online. Vari
ous terms have been used to refer to remote therapy (Rochlen
et al., 2004), and in this study, based on the most recent literature, we
use the term ‘telepsychotherapy’ to refer to psychotherapy sessions
provided synchronously online via videoconferencing (Markowitz
et al., 2020; Poletti et al., 2020; Rosen et al., 2020; Van Daele
et al., 2020).
Preliminary studies have shown that despite the involuntary tran
sition to TPT during the pandemic, therapists have a somewhat posi
tive view of TPT (Feijt et al., 2020, McBeath et al., 2020) and are
inclined to use it in the future (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020). In
earlier studies, several factors have been proposed that may impact
therapists' views of TPT (for a review, see Connolly et al., 2020). One
important factor is the perceived ability to develop a strong therapeu
tic relationship remotely (Roesler, 2017; Sucala et al., 2013). Pre
pandemic studies showed that in fact, the therapeutic relationship is
generally strong in TPT (see review by Norwood et al., 2018) and simi
lar to in-person therapies (e.g. Bouchard et al., 2020; Watts
et al., 2020). This was true not only pre-pandemic but during the pan
demic as well (Aafjes-van Doorn, Békés, & Prout, 2020; Aafjes-van
Doorn, Bekés, Prout, & Hoffman, 2020). Moreover, during the pan
demic, many therapists also reported that they were as authentic and
genuine in their online sessions as they were before in in-person
(Békés, Aafjes-van Doorn, et al., 2020; Békés, Grondin, & Bouchard,
2020).
Before the start of the pandemic, few therapists had attended
training in TPT, and most felt uncomfortable using technology to pro
vide psychotherapy (e.g. Essig & Russell, 2017; Glueckauf
et al., 2018). Therapists' sense of uncertainty regarding their ability to
provide effective therapy online likely further increased during this
sudden transition to TPT during the pandemic. Especially among ther
apists with less clinical and online experience at the start of the pan
demic, and those struggling to build strong therapy relationships,
professional self-doubt has been found to be salient (Aafjes-van
Doorn, Békés, & Prout, 2020).
Moreover, another salient factor in therapists' attitudes towards
TPT during the COVID-19 pandemic is their experience of vicarious
trauma. Due to the global health crisis and its negative mental health
impact, therapists may have been more exposed to more stressful and
traumatic material during their sessions than before the pandemic.
Indeed, previous studies showed that on average, therapists experi
enced a moderate level of vicarious trauma during the pandemic and
about 15% of therapists experienced high levels (Aafjes-van Doorn,
Bekés, Prout, & Hoffman, 2020).
These preliminary findings suggest that therapists' ability to cre
ate a strong therapeutic relationship online, their professional self
doubt and experienced vicarious trauma likely impact therapists'
acceptance of the TPT format. However, little is known about which
of these factors are most strongly associated with TPT acceptance
and how they interact with one another when relating to acceptance
of TPT technology during the pandemic.
Although traditional regression models and machine learning
models, such as decision trees, may both base their variable selection
on pre-existing theory, a decision tree model has certain statistical
benefits. Traditional statistical approaches test each independent vari
able as a separate hypothesis, which can lead to erroneous conclu
sions because of multiple comparisons (inflated Type I errors), model
misspecification and multicollinearity. In contrast, machine learning
models are not constrained by model assumptions and are particularly
helpful for finding patterns in complex datasets (Bi et al., 2019). A
decision tree model, for example, is able to predict the mean level of
the dependent variable based on exploring interactions between
potential independent variables (Loh, 2008). In an attempt to improve
the ability of identified models to generalize to new data that will be
collected in the future, a machine learning model is usually developed
in the training set and subsequently tested in a separate test set
(Aafjes-van Doorn et al., 2021). This process of cross-validation avoids
model overfit on the original data and mimics a replication of the
model on an independent dataset, and it thus increases the confi
dence in the model's generalizability.
The aims of the current study were twofold: (1) to examine the
extent of therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during the pan
demic and their attitudes towards TPT technology, concerns about
the TPT technology and intention to use TPT technology in the future
and (2) to develop predictive models for each of these three aspects
of therapists' acceptance of TPT technology, based on the therapists'
characteristics, reported quality of the therapeutic relationship in TPT
and their levels of professional self-doubt and vicarious trauma during
the pandemic by applying decision tree machine learning analyses.

2.1 | Procedures and participants
This cross-sectional study was based on Qualtrics-based online survey
data about psychotherapists' experiences and attitudes towards TPN
during the pandemic. Preliminary results on small subsamples based
on less than 20% of the presented data and focused on different
research questions have been published in previous reports (omitted
for peer review). The present study reports the results on all survey
Key Practitioner Message

data collected between 25 March and 29 June 2020. Psychothera
pists were recruited via professional email listservs, social media and
individual contacts across the United States, Canada, China and
Europe. Licensed and trainee therapists, currently seeing patients
online, were eligible to participate. Interested participants were
directed to an online survey platform, which provided additional infor
mation about the study. After providing consent, participants were
directed to the anonymous questionnaire. Several individual items and
standardized scales were administered in a fixed order, taking approxi
mately 15 min to complete. The study was approved by (the local
omitted for peer review) institutional review board.
In the present study, out of the 1911 participants who clicked on
the survey link, we included participants who completed all the relevant
measures (n = 795). Due to the forced response setting in the survey,
there were no missing data. The participating therapists were mostly
female (n = 603; 75.8%), and White (n = 562, 70.7%); their average age
was 52.72 (SD = 16.36), and more than half of the sample (n = 399,
57.2%) had more than 17 years of clinical experience, with only 7.9% of
therapists reporting 4 years of clinical experience or less. This sample is
representative of the larger population of US psychologists which is
65% female and 84% White and has a mean age of 45.9 (American Psy
chological Association, 2018). Most participating therapists were
located in North America (n = 650; 81.8%). Detailed demographic data
about the study sample are presented in Table 1.
2.2 | Measures
The online survey included individual items that assessed for thera
pists' demographics and professional activities as well as several stan
dardized scales that assessed for variables of interest, including
acceptance of TPT, vicarious trauma, professional self-doubt and
scales about the therapeutic relationship.
2.2.1 | Demographics and professional activities
Items included age, gender, race/ethnicity, highest degree, treatment
orientation and setting, patient population, licensure, years of experi
ence and number of patients. Additional items inquired about previ
ous TPT experience and training.
2.2.2 | Attitudes towards TPT
The novel Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Thera
pist Version (UTAUT-T; Békés et al., 2021) was used to assess attitudes
towards acceptance and usage of TPT. The UTAUT framework
(Venkatesh et al., 2003, 2012) offers a comprehensive model of accep
tance and subsequent utilization of technological innovations. It has been
adapted for various contexts, including occupational and physical therapy
(Liu et al., 2015). The UTAUT theoretical framework was recently used in
a systematic review of pre-pandemic empirical studies as an overarching
conceptualization of different aspects of acceptance of TPT technology
to help frame their inclusion criteria and description of their findings
(Connolly et al., 2020; see Venkatesh et al., 2016). In line with the focus
of the present study, the phrasing of the items was adapted to reflect
TPT. For example, the item ‘People who are important to me think that I
should use the system’ in the original UTAUT measure was adapted to
‘People who are important to me think that I should use online therapy’,
whereas other items needed more modifications, for example, the origi
nal ‘Using the system enables me to accomplish tasks more quickly’ was

adapted to therapists as ‘Using online therapy saves me time and/or
money’ (for more details on the development of UTAUT-T, see Békés
et al., 2021). The original and extended UTAUT models have been vali
dated in a variety of settings, including academic research (Gruzd
et al., 2012), higher education (Pynoo et al., 2011) and healthcare settings
(Alapetite et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2015), for a review,
see Venkatesh et al. (2016), whereas the novel UTAUT-T has not been
validated on therapist samples yet.
The UTAUT for psychotherapists includes three scales: Atti
tudes, Anxiety and Behavioural Intention. The 21-item UTAUT-T
Attitudes subscale includes items related to performance expec
tancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions
regarding using TPT. The six-item UTAUT-T Anxiety subscale
includes items regarding feelings of apprehension or concerns about
using technology (Compeau et al., 1999). The Anxiety subscale has
been shown to have a direct negative effect on actual technology
use and is thus seen as an important inhibitory variable
(Cenfetelli & Schwarz, 2011). Finally, the two-item UTAUT-T Behav
ioural Intention subscale represents explicitly declared intent and
plan to use technology in the future.
As with all UTAUT adaptations, items of the UTAUT-T scales are
scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree), with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes towards tech
nology (Attitudes Scale), more concerns (Anxiety Scale) and more inten
tion for future use of TPN (Behavioural Intention Scale). In the present
study, the internal consistency of the UTAUT-T subscales was α = .78
(Attitudes), α = .80 (Anxiety) and α = .94 (Behavioural Intention).
2.2.3 | Working alliance
Therapeutic alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory
– Short Revised – Therapist (WAI-SRT; Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006) which
includes four positively worded items for each of three subscales, based
on Bordin's (1979) pantheoretical model: bond, agreement on tasks and
agreement on goals. The WAI-SRT uses a 5-point Likert scale, ranging
from seldom (1) to always (5), and has been validated by associations
with other alliance measures and by prediction of therapy outcomes
(Munder et al., 2010; Zilcha-Mano, 2017).
A global working alliance rating of 4 (sometimes), the middle point
of the scale, is interpreted as a neutral working alliance (Horvath &
Greenberg, 1989). The WAI-SRT has shown adequate reliability and
validity (Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006). The mean score of the WAI-SRT
was used, with higher scores indicating a stronger working alliance.
Cronbach's α for the total scale in the current sample was .85.
2.2.4 | Real relationship
The Real Relationship Inventory Therapist Form (RRI-T; Gelso
et al., 2005) assesses the genuine human relationship between patient
and therapist from the therapist perspective. In Gelso's tripartite
model (Gelso et al., 2018), the RR is conceptualized as an ongoing
quality of the relationship distinguished from transference and the
working alliance. The RR has been found to be highly correlated with
the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath & Greenberg, 1989),
especially with the WAI's Bond subscale (Kelley et al., 2010); however,
ratings of real relationship predict treatment progress and outcome
above and beyond the variance explained by the WAI (Lo Coco
et al., 2011; Marmarosh et al., 2009). The RRI has 24 items that use a
5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), with
higher overall scores reflecting a more genuine and authentic relation
ship. Reliability has shown to be high, with coefficient alphas ranging
from .80 to .90 in various samples (e.g. Fuertes et al., 2013, 2019;
Marmarosh et al., 2009). In this study, Cronbach's α was .73.
2.2.5 | Professional self-doubt
The Professional Self-Doubt Scale (PSD; Nissen-Lie et al., 2017) is a
nine-item scale derived from the larger Development of Psychothera
pists Common Core Questionnaire (DPCCQ; Orlinsky et al., 1999). The
PSD assesses the level of uncertainty a therapist has in their ability to
help a patient. Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to
5 (very often), with higher total score indicating more self-doubt. The
PSD includes nine items about how confident and competent the thera
pist feels, and items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to
5 (very often) and summed for a total score, with higher scores indicating
more self-doubt. In our study, Cronbach's α was .84.
2.2.6 | Vicarious trauma
The Vicarious Trauma Survey (VTS; Vrklevski & Franklin, 2008) is a self
report measure of distress associated with working with traumatized
patients. The VTS includes eight items, from which the first two ask
about vicarious trauma exposure, whereas the other six ask about dis
tress due to the exposure. Because the first two items are screening
questions and do not assess the subjective experience of vicarious trau
matization (Aparicio et al., 2013), in the present study, we used the cal
culated sum of the six distress items. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert
scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7), where higher scores
indicate more VT. The VTS has strong psychometric properties
(Aparicio et al., 2013; Benuto et al., 2018; Michalopoulos &
Aparicio, 2012), with alpha .77 for the six-item version (Aparicio
et al., 2013). Cronbach's α for the total scale in the current sample was
.81, and for the six-item subjective VTS, it was .83.
2.3 | Data analysis
2.3.1 | Machine learning regression decision tree analyses
The primary aim of the analyses was to develop a prediction model of
the therapists' acceptance of the TPT format and their attitudes,

concerns and intention for future use of videoconferencing. The three
dependent variables were UTAUT-T Attitudes subscale, UTAUT-T Con
cerns subscale and UTAUT-T Behavioural Intention subscale. Based on
the aforementioned clinical theory, we entered the following potential
independent variables in the models: therapists' age and gender, as well
as reported mean ratings of the real relationship, working alliance, pro
fessional self-doubt and vicarious trauma scale. Based on general rec
ommendation for machine learning models (Vrigazova, 2021) and
common practice (e.g. Prout et al., 2020), the dataset was randomly split
into two sets using PROC SURVEYSELECT of SAS: a training set (70%,
n = 556) and a test set (30%, n = 239).
For this purpose, regression decision tree analyses were run with
the R party package (Hothorn et al., 2006) using Monte Carlo simulation
for multiple-testing adjustment (Strasser & Weber, 1999). The workings
of the decision tree algorithm can be described as follows. First, the null
hypothesis of independence between each of the six independent
(i.e. input) variables and the respective response dependent
(i.e. response) variable was tested. If the independent variable had no
association to the dependent variable, this variable was not included in
the model. A random selection of independent variables was performed
based on the strength of their association with the dependent variable;
the first selected independent variable had the strongest association to
the dependent variable. This association is estimated by a p-value
corresponding to a test for the partial null hypothesis of a single inde
pendent variable and the dependent variable. Subsequently, the algo
rithm implemented a binary split in the selected independent variable,
based on the corresponding p-value of less than .01. These steps were
repeated recursively for each of the independent variables that were
significantly associated with the dependent variable, until no remaining
variable was associated with the dependent variable. As is common and
recommended in prediction models (Loh, 2008), performance of deci
sion trees was evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE;
Kenney & Keeping, 1962) and R2 (Glantz & Slinker, 2001) of the test set
compared to these values in the training set.1 The R Foundation for Sta
tistical Computing Version (3.6.1) was utilized for the tree analysis.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during COVID-19
3.1.1 | Descriptives
For an overview of the descriptive statistics of all standardized mea
sures, see Table 2. Overall, therapists reported somewhat positive atti
tudes towards TPT. On average, therapists were relatively concerned
about providing therapy as well as undecided as to whether they would
like to continue using TPT in the future (i.e. expressed as a neutral
response on the UTUAT Behaviour Intention subscale), with large dif
ferences among therapists. The real relationship scores were similar or
higher compared to scores found in previous studies in in-person treat
ments before the pandemic (Bhatia & Gelso, 2018; Gelso et al., 2012).
The real relationship has not been previously assessed with regard to
online therapies. The working alliance scores on the WAI-SRT in our
sample were similar to therapist-rated alliance scores on this same mea
sure in previous studies in blended (combined in-person and online)
therapy that was conducted before the abrupt transition to online ther
apies due to the pandemic (Vernmark et al., 2019).
On average, therapists experienced professional self-doubt some
times or frequently in TPN during the pandemic, which is higher than
the level of self-doubt experienced by therapists in a prior naturalistic
study of PSD (Nissen-Lie et al., 2013) but still on the lower end of the
5-point Likert scale. The sample in our study reported significantly
higher subjective VT compared to previously found pre-pandemic in
person sessions (Michalopoulos & Aparicio, 2012).
3.1.2 | Preliminary analyses
The UTAUT Attitude Scale significantly correlated with all indepen
dent variables, except for age and gender. The UTAUT Anxiety Scale
significantly correlated with all independent variables. The UTAUT
Behavioural Intention Scale correlated with UTAUT Attitude and Anx
iety Scales, working alliance and professional self-doubt, but correla
tions with age, gender, real relationship and vicarious trauma were
non-significant. After applying a Bonferroni correction (i.e. p < .005),
the correlation between UTAUT Anxiety and gender was no longer
significant. All the other correlations remained significant (when
applying p < .005; see Table 3).
3.2 | Prediction of therapists' acceptance of TPT technology during COVID
Predicting models were trained on the train set (n = 556) and were
assessed for predictive performance on the test set (n = 239). Three
separate decision tree models were developed to predict the three
aspects of acceptance of TPT technology.
3.2.1 | Predicting therapists' attitudes towards TPT
The regression tree model showed that higher alliance ratings
(WAI > 3.9) was associated with more positive attitudes. Those with
the higher alliance ratings (WAI > 3.9) with relatively low professional
self-doubt (PD < =2.1) and younger than 40 reported the most posi
tive attitudes. Therapists who reported the lowest alliance rates
(WAI = <3) also reported the most negative attitudes (Figure 1).
3.2.2 | Predicting therapists' concerns about TPT
The regression tree model showed that therapists with the highest
levels of professional self-doubt (PSD > 2.89) reported the most con
cern on UTAUT Anxiety. Those with relatively low levels of

professional self-doubt (PSD < 1.67) and low levels of vicarious
trauma (VTS < 1.17) reported the least concern about using the online
platform (Figure 2).
3.2.3 | Predicting therapists' intention to use TPT in the future
The regression tree model showed that therapists who reported
higher working alliance (WAI > 3) also reported more intention to use
TPT in the future (Figure 3).
3.3 | Predictive performance
The performance of the model of prediction for UTAUT-T Attitudes
was relatively good in that it had the second best R2 in the models
(0.15) and the best RMSE values (0.51), the test set's RMSE value was
0.48 and the R2 was 0.46. Prediction of UTAUT-T Anxiety had the

same as the train set correspondence values. Taken together, the pre
dictive criteria results of the test set were the same as in the training
set when predicting UTAUT-T Behavioural Intention and UTAUT-T
Anxiety. The ability to predict UTAUT-T Attitudes was marginally
poorer in the test than in the training set. The relatively similar model
performances in the training and test set indicate that the model pre
diction abilities remained when applied to new data. Table 4 summa
rized the predictive criteria values on the three outcomes. In addition,
we tested a dummy model and found higher RMSE for all three sub
scales (Attitudes RMSE = .51, Anxiety RMSE = .85 and Behavioural
Intention RMSE = 1.18) compared to the test set, which indicates that
the reported model has better predictive power than the dummy
model.
4 | DISCUSSION
In the present study, we examined different aspects of therapists'
acceptance of TPT technology (i.e. therapists' attitudes, concerns and
intention for future utilization of TPT) as well as the therapists'
reported therapeutic relationship with their online patients, their
levels of professional self-doubt and vicarious trauma, as experienced
in online sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored how
these TPT experiences (the therapist-reported therapeutic relation
ship with their online patients, their levels of professional self-doubt
and vicarious trauma) might relate to the different aspects of thera
pists' acceptance of TPT technology. In order to develop and cross
validate predictive models, we divided our collected survey responses
from 795 therapists into a larger training-set subsample and a smaller
test-set subsample. We then used a machine learning decision tree
approach to build predictive models in the training set, before cross
validating the performance of these models on the test set.
Our survey responses from 795 therapists indicated that thera
pists had neutral or moderately positive attitudes while also many
concerns regarding TPT, and on average, they were undecided about
whether or not they would use TPT in the future. Therapists experi
enced the therapeutic relationship with their patients in their online
sessions positively: They reported similar levels of working alliance
and higher levels of real relationship in their online sessions during the
pandemic compared to in-person levels in previous studies conducted
pre-pandemic (e.g. blended therapy, i.e. online modules combined
with therapist sessions; Vernmark et al., 2019 and in-person therapy;
Bhatia & Gelso, 2018, respectively). Therapists experienced higher
levels of professional self-doubt and higher levels of vicarious trauma
than was reported in previous studies on in-person therapies (Aparicio
et al., 2012).
When we tested three aspects of the acceptance of TPT technol
ogy (attitudes, concerns, future intention to use), the first model
showed that therapist-reported working alliance was most pertinent
to be associated with attitudes towards TPT, in that sufficiently high
alliance scores were associated with more positive attitudes, and most
positive attitudes were reported by those who also experienced little
professional doubt and were 40 years old or younger. Therapists who
reported the weakest quality of the working alliance also reported the

most negative attitudes towards TPT technology. Therapists' concerns
about TPT technology was most pertinently associated with the ther
apist's professional self-doubt, in that therapists with very little pro
fessional doubt (i.e. the most professionally confident therapists) had
the least concerns about TPT, and concerns were the lowest for those
who also reported low levels of vicarious trauma during the start of
the pandemic. The prediction model for the intention to use TPT tech
nology showed that the only pertinent predictor was working alliance.
The majority of therapists who reported at least a medium level of
working alliance were inclined to use TPT in the future, whereas a
small subgroup of therapists who reported weak alliance also reported
the least likelihood to use TPT in the future.
Unlike previous research on in-person therapies pre-pandemic
that suggested that besides the working alliance, the quality of the
real relationship is also important in predicting treatment efficacy
(Bhatia & Gelso, 2018), the real relationship did not appear to play
an important role in therapists' acceptance of TPT technology. In
none of the three models, their reported level of the real relation
ship (RR) with their online patients was associated with any of the
three dependent variables, once the independent variables that
were more strongly associated with each of the dependent variables
were included in the models, and therefore did not show in the
respective decision trees. Similarly, gender of the therapist was not
relevant in predicting any of the aspects of the therapists' accep
tance of TPT technology.
Overall, these results indicate that therapists' professional self
doubt and the working alliance that they perceive with their online
patients are the most prominent factors in predicting their reported
acceptance of TPT. Our study findings partly confirmed previous
results that therapists are often reluctant to use TPT due to fears of
being unable to build a strong therapy relationship with their patients
online (Roesler, 2017). In line with previous studies, based on patient
self-reported alliance measures, that reported that the working alli
ance in online therapies may be just as strong as in in-person thera
pies (Norwood et al., 2018), we found similar ratings of the online
working alliance in our participating therapists.
Our results also highlight that concerns about the use of TPT is
not pertinent to the therapists' ability to build a strong working alli
ance online, but rather to their professional self-doubt and experience
of vicarious traumatization in their online work. This might imply that
therapists can benefit from their own professional support in order to
reduce their professional anxiety during the pandemic and more gen
erally. Moreover, although professional self-doubt was linked to bet
ter treatment outcomes in a previous study of trainees (Nissen-Lie
et al., 2013), our study showed that the experience of more profes
sional self-doubt was negatively related to therapists' attitudes and
positively related to concerns about TPT technology. Thus, profes
sional self-doubt is an important area to address in practitioners in
order to promote the acceptance of TPT as a potential treatment
format. Future research is needed to assess whether professional self
doubt relates specifically to concerns about TPT or to providing
therapy in general, including in-person settings. Future research might
also be warranted in examining how best to target and reduce
therapists' sense of professional competence and confidence when
applying new therapy technology.
Finally, vicarious trauma was only associated with concerns about
TPT; it was unrelated to attitudes towards or to future intention to

use TPT. And even within the model predicting concerns about TPT, it
was not as pertinent as the therapists' experienced professional self
doubt. Earlier research has shown that vicarious trauma has a negative
impact on treatment effectiveness (Sexton, 1999), and this impact is
especially strong when therapists and patients experience a disaster
simultaneously (Boscarino et al., 2004; Culver et al., 2011). In our
study, during the pandemic, providing treatment remotely to patients
dealing with traumatic stress represents a serious challenge. Before
the pandemic, therapists considered severe psychopathology and
acute crisis situations as counter-indicators of online treatment
(Connolly et al., 2020; Simms et al., 2011); however, during the pan
demic, there was no alternative to TPT. Our findings about height
ened concerns regarding TPT in those with more subjective vicarious
trauma experiences possibly reflect the therapists' general sense of
anxiety during the pandemic or the impact of therapists' subjective
experiences of stress and overwhelm on their ability to be open
minded to new technology/ways of working. Also, due to the pan
demic, therapists were probably more frequently exposed to highly
stressful material in their sessions, and given that the stress of the
pandemic impacts the therapists as well, they might have less emo
tional capacity to deal with their patients' trauma presentations. The
heightened vicarious trauma experience in itself is an alarming fact,
and its impact on concerns regarding TPT need to also be taken seri
ously when considering ways of using TPT with patients under high
stress.
Our results show that despite concerns described in previous lit
erature about relational aspects of TPT (Roesler, 2017; Sucala
et al., 2013), the actual experience of working alliance and real rela
tionship in online sessions was relatively positive. In fact, the quality
of the real relationship was higher than in previous reports in in
person therapies (Bhatia & Gelso, 2018; Gelso et al., 2012), even
though due to the different study designs, these comparisons should
be taken with some caution. Given that the quality of the therapeutic
relationship is known to predict positive treatment outcomes, this
finding provides some optimism regarding the potential impact of
ongoing TPT. However, our study also indicated that therapists' rela
tional challenges are a central factor in determining their attitudes and
future intention to utilize TPT. Difficulties with building strong rela
tionships with patients may not only decrease treatment efficacy but
also hinder the utilization of TPT in the future. Future research on
how therapists' can be helped to build a sufficient working alliance
with patients, especially within an TPT format could be important to
ensure therapists will feel comfortable enough offering the option of
TPT to their patients.
The moderate levels of professional self-doubt found in this study
are understandable in light of the sudden transition to a TPT format
and related practical and professional challenges, as well as the gen
eral stress of the pandemic on both therapists and their patients, that
may have triggered doubts about professional skills and abilities.
However, the experiences during the pandemic may have long-term
consequences on the continued use of the TPT format.
4.1 | Clinical implications
Our findings might give an indication of which therapists might need
more support if required to deliver therapy online. There is a need for
training and support on (1) reducing and tolerating professional self
doubt related to TPT technology; (2) further developing skills to
strengthen the relationship in TPT sessions; and (3) identifying thera
pists who are experiencing vicarious trauma and providing additional
support and care.
Providing therapy remotely has its own unique challenges, includ
ing the lack of certain aspects of non-verbal communication, which
may hinder understanding of the patients' emotional state or the ther
apist's ability to sufficiently transmit their own emotions and empathy
(Wagnild et al., 2006). Training courses could provide tools to com
pensate for these aspects of TPT and help therapists to improve their
online communication skills to enhance the therapeutic relationship
online, and maybe most importantly, their sense of professional com
petence and confidence. Professional training and peer support
groups are also valuable resources for ameliorating the subjective
sense of vicarious traumatization while working during a global pan
demic that impacts both patient and therapist.
In many countries, therapy is delivered as part of government
funded services, so decisions about mode of delivery are likely to be
out of clinicians' hands. However, the increased clinical and research
interest in TPT might mean that TPT will be more readily accepted by
patients, therapists and payers. Given that more positive attitudes
towards a treatment process tend to relate to better treatment out
comes, this bodes well for patients' well-being. Although previously
clinicians were required to provide in-person therapy to ensure gov
ernmental funding, in the near future, clinicians might be able to make
a clinical decision to determine which therapeutic format might be
most beneficial to a patient at a given time. Of course, the use of in
person therapy or TPT does not have to be a binary clinical decision.
Therapists and patients might consider integrating TPT sessions
within an in-person treatment or do the full treatment via TPT tech
nology (Van Daele et al., 2021). Patients may receive a combination of
in-person and remote sessions based on changing needs over the
course of therapy (Yellowlees & Nafiz, 2010).
4.2 | Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, even though in our study
we built the prediction models based on the well-supported
assumption that attitudes towards TPT may be predicted by various
factors (Connolly et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2016), including the
relationship, professional doubt and vicarious trauma variables, a
reverse causation may also be argued for. For example, it is possible
that preconceived attitudes towards TPT may prevent therapists
from trying to build strong therapeutic relationships in their online
sessions.

Second, even though the comparison between our sample and
samples reported in previously published studies may be informative,
these comparisons need to be interpreted with caution due to various
confounders (e.g. different therapist and patient and treatment char
acteristics in these studies).
Third, we used a convenience sample of therapists willing to
report about their experiences during the pandemic in an online sur
vey. Although our sample was relatively diverse, most respondents
were female (as is the case in many survey studies; Moore &
Tarnai, 2002). At the same time, this is representative of the larger
population of psychologists (American Psychological Association,
2015). Therapists who volunteered to participate might also have
been especially interested in TPT, which possibly biased the results.
Fourth, a well-known limitation, common to all survey research, is
that all variables were self-reported responses, which means that the
relationship between these variables might have been spuriously
inflated. Future research could benefit from using complementary
methods to gain information about therapists' acceptance of TPT
technology, for example, by having observer codings of behaviour of
therapists or by interviewing supervisors and patients to gain their
perspective on the therapist's attitudes.
Finally, although the present study reports on a rigorous cross
validation method for producing results that are likely to be generaliz
able to the broader population, this must be viewed as internal
validation, rather than external validation, as the test set is still a sub
sample of the original dataset, rather than an entirely new or separate
sample (Aafjes-van Doorn et al., 2021). Thus, it is possible that the
identified independent variables may not generalize to new samples
of other therapists and that an additional out-of-sample external
validation would further strengthen the generalizability of our findings
(Sammut & Webb, 2017).
4.3 | Conclusion
This large survey study of therapists' acceptance of TPT technology
during the first weeks of COVID-19 indicates that therapists had rela
tively positive attitudes towards TPT technology and some concerns
about using TPT in the future. The most consistent factor influencing
therapists' acceptance levels was their professional self-doubt as well
as their perceived quality of the online working alliance. This implies
that professional support and training might be helpful in increasing
therapists' sense of professional and relational competence and confi
dence online, and therefore generating a more positive attitude, fewer
concerns and a higher likelihood of continued use of TPT technology
in the future, when it is no longer a health requirement.
