Abstract
A poorly understood, major event in heart evolution is the convergent prioritization
in mammals and birds of compact myocardium over trabecular myocardium. Com
pact myocardium is thought to facilitate the greater cardiac outputs that distinguish
endothermic mammals and birds from ectotherms, but the underlying mechanism
remains unclear. We used transcriptomics to investigate whether the compact layer
myocardium is intrinsically different from that of the trabecular layer. In the embry
onic mouse heart, spatial transcriptomics revealed that 3% of detected genes were
differentially expressed between trabecular and compact myocardium. In the adult,
this analysis yielded only 0.2% differentially expressed genes. Additionally, the tran
scriptomes of both embryonic trabecular and compact myocardium greatly differed
from those of the adult myocardium. Reanalysis of available single-cell transcrip
tomes showed relationships between human embryonic and adult trabecular and
compact myocardium similar to those in mice. Analysis of new and published tran
scriptomes from adult zebra finch, zebrafish, and tuna revealed few differentially
expressed genes (<0.6%) and no conservation between species. We conclude that
the transcriptional states of developing trabecular and compact myocardium do not
persist into adulthood. In adult hearts, the compact layer myocardium is not intrin
sically different from that of the trabecular layer despite the overt morphological
differences.

INTRODUCTION
The structure of the vertebrate ventricular wall exhibits two distinct
architectures. In most species, the ventricle is predominantly filled

layer of compact muscle. In contrast, mammalian and bird species pos

myocardium and fewer, more defined trabeculations.1
The metabolism of endotherms, represented here by mammals and
birds, is significantly higher than that of ectotherms. It is associated

with greater systemic blood pressure that requires a greater cardiac
output and increased tissue perfusion of blood. To raise cardiac output,
either stroke volume, or heart rate or both must be elevated. Increas
ing the stroke volume requires increasing the size of the heart, which
can only be done to a limited extent. Heart rate, on the other hand,
is markedly elevated in mammals and birds relative to ectotherms
that are matched for body size and temperature.2 Therefore, elevated
blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are correlated with
ventricles with a high ratio of compact-to-trabecular wall thickness
and a large cavity. The causal relationship, if it exists, has not been
established.3,4
Theoretical arguments have been made that the highly trabeculated
ventricles of ectotherms would offer higher resistance to blood flow,
and would, therefore, be unable to fill and eject blood at the high fre
quencies seen in endotherms.1 Also, the trabecular tissue organization
may limit the speed of electrical activation.5 In humans, it was recently
assessed that the myocardium of the trabecular and compact layers is
similar when multiple lines of evidence were reviewed.6 One largely
unexplored possibility is that the cellular phenotype of the cardiomy
ocytes of the trabecular and compact myocardium is substantially
different from each other. Among fish, the proportion of myocardium
that is organized in a compact fashion can vary from close to 0%, up
to 70% in the ventricles of some tuna species (e.g., the bigeye tuna7),
although these high values have also been questioned.8,9 The presump
tion is that this variation relates to functional differences, although
it is unclear what that relation could be.10,11 If the myocardium of
the trabecular and compact layers is substantially different from each
other, the compact-to-trabecular ratios could be a basis that evolu
tionary pressures may select on. Certain phenotypic differences can
be found in the embryonic mammalian and avian hearts, where several
genes are differentially expressed between the trabecular and compact
layer.12 For some of the most well-known genes, such as Gja5, Nppa,
Tbx5(a), and Hey2, we know there is also a differential expression in
the ventricular wall of reptiles, amphibians, and fish.13–16 Conversely,
across vertebrates and thus various ventricular morphologies, myocar
dial mass is a strong predictor of the product of cardiac output and
systolic blood pressure. This suggests that the myocardium of the tra
becular and compact layers has similar properties.3,17 Thus, there are
some indications that the myocardium of the trabecular and compact
layer are different, and other indications that the myocardium is largely
similar.
While the high degree of variation in cardiac chamber morphol
ogy between chambers of any heart as well as between species is
clear, the significance of this variation is not. In this study, we inves
tigated the hypothesis that trabecular and compact myocardium are
phenotypically different by comparing the transcriptomes of trabecu
lar and compact myocardium of adult hearts of different endothermic
and ectothermic vertebrate species. As a point of reference, we com
pared the transcriptomes of mouse and human embryonic trabecular
and compact myocardium, of which pronounced differences are known
from the literature. We found that despite the significant phenotypic
differences seen in the embryonic heart, these do not persist in the
adult heart.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Animal care, housing, husbandry, and protocols were performed in
accordance with guidelines from the Directive 2010/63/EU of the
European Parliament and the Dutch government. Protocols were
approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of the Amsterdam
University Medical Centers.
Animals
Mice
Animals were housed in Innovive IVC disposable cages (522.6 cm2,
12.7 cm headroom), with corncob bedding and a cardboard house and
tissues for enrichment. The cages contained a maximum of seven mice
when their individual weights were 20–25 g, six mice between 26 and
30 g, and five mice over 30 g. The mice received acidified sterile drink
ing water (Innovive M-WB-300A, 2.5-3.0 pH) in the cage lid provided
ad libitum. The mice were provided Teklad 2916 kibble ad libitum. The
temperature in the facility was kept between 20◦C and 24◦C, with a
relative humidity of between 45% and 65%. Lights were on between
07:00 and 19:00 at 60 lux.
FVB/NJ wild-type mouse embryos (Mus musculus, Janvier labs, www.
janvier-labs.com) of 14.5 gestational days were obtained from in-house
bred litters. Pregnant mice were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane
1 L/min for 5 min, followed by cervical dislocation. Eight-week-old
adult mice were asphyxiated in CO2 followed by cervical dislocation.
Embryos and hearts were harvested in 1X phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) at 4◦C and fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS for 24 h. The sex of
the individuals was unknown.
Zebra finch
We sampled five zebra finches that were raised in a breeding colony
at Leiden University, The Netherlands. After catching, the birds were
immediately killed by cervical dislocation, and the chest was opened.
The use of postmortem material of animals culled as breeding sur
plus is not considered a procedure in itself in accordance with the
Experiments on Animals Act (Wet op dierproeven, 2014).18 This is
the applicable legislation in The Netherlands in accordance with the
European guidelines (EU directive no. 2010/63/EU) regarding the pro
tection of animals used for scientific purposes. Therefore, a license was
not obtained for the procedure. All zebra finches were housed and
cared for in accordance with these regulations and internal guidelines
concerning the care of the animals and licensing and skill of person
nel. This also includes advice that was taken from the animal welfare
body Leiden to minimize suffering for all animals at the facility (with
or without a license). From four of these finches, we sampled trabecu
lar left ventricular tissue, compact left ventricular tissue, and the right

ventricular free wall. As an outgroup to the ventricular samples, we also
sequenced parts of the right atrioventricular junction, which included
the muscular valve that is characteristic of the avian heart.19 These
samples were expected to contain tissue from both the right atrium,
right ventricle, and the atrioventricular sulcus. The fifth finch heart
was fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS for 24 h, before being embed
ded for histological purposes. Picrosirius red staining was performed
as previously described.13
RNA sequencing of zebra finch tissue
RNA was isolated using the ReliaPrep RNA Tissue Miniprep System
(Promega Benelux). The protocol for Isolation of RNA from fibrous tis
sue was used. Four birds were sacrificed and used for dissecting tissue.
Tapestation 4200 (Agilent) was used to confirm RNA integrity. Library
preparation and RNA sequencing were performed at the Core Facility
Genomics at the Amsterdam UMC. For library preparation, KAPA RNA
HyperPrep with RiboErase (Roche) was used. The sequencing platform
used was Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) and the sequencing method
used was S4.300 (PE150).
Paired-end reads were mapped to the zebra finch transcriptome
(bTaeGut1_v1) using STAR.20 All samples had >50% uniquely mapped
reads. The ensemble genome annotation bTaeGut1_v1 contains 22,150
genes and after filtering for genes with at least 10 counts we retained
15,351 genes.
Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler analysis
Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial profiler (Nanostring) was used in
combination with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Mouse RNA
probe mix (v1) for NGS on paraplast-embedded fixed embryos and
adult mouse hearts according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Anti
cTnI (Hytest 4T21/2, 1:150) together with anti-Goat AlexaFluor 555
(Thermofisher Scientific A-21432, 1:250) and SytoxGreen nuclear
stain (Invitrogen S7020) were used to manually segment regions of
interest. cTnI signal-based masking was used to further specify areas
of interest (AOIs), enriching for cardiomyocytes.
After selecting the AOIs, oligos were collected into a 96-well plate
for library preparation and subsequent sequencing. Sequencing depth
was determined by calculating the total area of all AOIs (μm2), and
multiplying this by the Nanostring recommended Sequencing Depth
Factor (100 for the Whole Transcriptome Atlas). Sequencing was
performed on the NextSeq 1000 (Illumina).
FASTQ files were trimmed, stitched, aligned, and deduplicated
using the Nanostring GeoMx NGS pipeline (version 2.3.3.10). The
generated DCC files were processed with the R GeoMxTools pack
age (version 3.8.0) using the configuration file, the sample sheet, and
the probe metadata file (v1). Normalization was performed using
quantile-normalization. For hypothesis testing, a Wald test was per
formed and the multiple testing correction was performed using the
Benjamini−Hochberg method. Differentially expressed genes were
defined as an adjusted p-value <0.05 and a log2 fold-change >0.25. All
graphs were made in R (v4.3.1), using the package ggplot2 (v3.4.2) and
ggrepel (v0.9.3).
RNA sequencing analysis
Bulk RNA sequencing analysis was performed using DESeq2.21
Genes with fewer than 10 counts were removed. Normalization
was performed using the DEseq2 (v3.17) variance-stabilizing trans
formation method. For hypothesis testing, a Wald test was per
formed and the multiple testing correction was performed using the
Benjamini−Hochberg method. Differentially expressed genes were
defined as an adjusted p-value <0.05 and a log2 fold-change >0.25. All
graphs were made in R (v4.3.1), using the package ggplot2 (v3.4.2) and
ggrepel (v0.9.3).
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
Seurat v422 was used for the analysis of all single-cell RNA sequencing
data. Data were filtered using the following criteria:
∙ Hill et al.23
• Percent mitochondrial genes: <25%
• nFeature: >1000, <30,000
• nCount: >500, <6000
∙ Asp et al.24
• Percent mitochondrial genes: <25%
• nFeature: >200, <6000
• nCount: >500, <50,000
∙ Kanemaru et al.25
• Percent mitochondrial genes: <5% (Single nucleus RNA seq)
• nFeature: >200, <6000
• nCount: >500, <60,000
∙ Galow et al.26
• Percent mitochondrial genes: <5% (Single nucleus RNA seq)
• nFeature: >200, <5000
• nCount: >500, <6000
Normalization and scaling were performed using SCTransform, v2,
regressing out the percentage of mitochondrial genes. Furthermore,
the Harmony package (v1.2.0) was used to integrate biological repli
cates. After performing this, DimPlot using group_by was used to
identify bias in clustering based on a number of variables if provided:
sex, age, heart region, individual, cell cycle phase, and sequencing assay.
Furthermore, the percentage of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes
was assessed to see if clusters emerged based on these features. For
the adult human data, we performed integration using the Harmony
package (v1.2.0), based on the individuals.27
Embryonic marker genes that were used to identify cardiomyocytes
of the trabecular layer were Nppa, Nppb, Gja5, Gja1, Bmp10, Scn5a,
Tbx5, Sema3a, Irx3, and Irx5. For the cardiomyocytes of the compact

Pseudo-bulk analysis was used for differential gene expression anal
ysis, using AggregateExpression to combine cells from clusters while
keeping the biological individual separated. The Z-score was calculated
to allow comparison between separate datasets, performed on log sta
bilized values, and produced by the rlog function from the DESeq2
package (v3.17). Differentially expressed genes were defined as an
adjusted p-value <0.05 and a log2 fold-change >0.25. Correlation anal
ysis between cell clusters from different datasets was performed using
a Pearson correlation.
For the human embryonic data, the differential gene expression
analysis was performed using Seurat’s function FindMarkers, because
DESeq2 is unable to work with n = 1 biological replicates.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the ventricles of species of several major vertebrate
lineages. The morphological structures of these ventricles show a
clear dichotomy between the endothermic species (represented by the
mouse and the zebra finch) and the ectothermic species (zebrafish,
tuna, clawed frog, and skink). The ventricular lumen of ectothermic
species is traversed by a high number of very fine trabeculations.35
Furthermore, generally, the compact wall is quite thin, although excep
tions, such as in the tuna, are observed. As a significant fraction of the
ventricle is made up by the trabecular layer, the ratio of compact to tra
becular remains relatively low in all cases. In endothermic hearts, on
the other hand, most of the lumen is open cavity. The trabeculations are
fewer and thicker than those found in ectotherms and the compact wall
is relatively thick, leading to a higher ratio of compact-to-trabecular
myocardium.
We assessed the extent of the trabecular layer by identifying the
deepest point of the intertrabecular recesses, which are part of the
ventricular cavity. In the ventricle of the clawed frog (Figure 1), we find
essentially no myocardium that is not directly in contact with the ven
tricular cavity (meaning that the compact myocardium makes up a very
low percentage of the ventricle mass).
Spatial transcriptome analysis of murine hearts reveals loss of embryonic transmural differences in the adult ventricular myocardium
In this paper, we assess the transcriptomes of the myocardium or car
diomyocytes from the trabeculated and compact myocardium from
several different species, aiming to determine whether the cardiomy
ocytes in these layers show a different phenotype.
As the primary line of evidence, we employed spatial transcrip
tomics using the GeoMX DSP platform because this combines high
resolution spatial information to distinguish the trabecular and com
pact layer with transcriptional profiles. Figure 2A,B shows representa
tive histological slides of the embryonic and the adult ventricles used.
Morphological regions that clearly identified trabecular and compact
layers containing about 250–350 nuclei each were selected for suf
ficient signal strength, while the zone in between the trabecular and
compact layers was not included in the selections to ensure signal
specificity. The Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas probe set contains
19,963 genes and expression above the limit-of-quantification was
detected for at least half of these genes. Cardiomyocyte-specific genes,

such as Ttn, Tnnt2, Tnni3, Mybpc3, and Actn2, were among the most
frequently detected and highest expressed genes, indicating that the
regions are strongly enriched for cardiomyocytes.
The embryonic ventricle revealed 606 differentially expressed
genes between the trabecular and compact myocardium, which repre
sents about 3% of all detected genes. Several genes have been found
to exhibit transmural (i.e., from endocardium to epicardium) expres
sion patterns in the embryonic hearts of mice and humans. Some
genes exhibit shallow gradients such as Tbx20, Mycn, Tbx5, and Gja1,
whereas other genes exhibit steeper gradients, being nearly exclu
sively expressed in their respective layers, such as Hey2, Nppa, and

layer to be more proliferative, and differences in metabolism between
the two layers have been observed.31,37 Our spatial transcriptomic

analysis of the embryonic mouse left ventricle validates genes with a
previously established transmural expression gradient and additionally
provides a transcriptome-wide profile of genes differentially expressed
between the trabecular and compact myocardium (Figure 2A).
We also analyzed a second and independent line of evidence,
namely, single-cell RNA sequencing data of more than 25,000 cells
from E13.5 mouse hearts generated by Hill et al.23 While this approach
does not contain spatial information, it can be used for a more nuanced
analysis of cell states. As the data contained all cell types, we first
identified the general cell types, such as fibroblasts (Vim+, Pdgfrb+),
endothelium (Cdh5+, Npr3−), endocardium (Cdh5+, Npr3+), epicardium
(Upk3b+), and cardiomyocytes (Tnnt2+). Within the cardiomyocytes, we
were able to identify the ventricular (Myh7+) and atrial (Nppa+/Myh6+/
Myl7+) cardiomyocytes.38,39
Next, we tested whether the ventricular cardiomyocytes only could
be clustered further. Two clusters were found that were distinct by
1306 differentially expressed genes (8.1% of all detected genes, log2
fold change >0.25, p-adjusted <0.05). Cells of one cluster had greater
Nppa expression levels, while cells of the other cluster had a much
greater Hey2 expression level. Moreover, 524 of the differentially
expressed genes found in our spatial transcriptomics analysis were also
found in the single cell-based dataset (Figure 2C). This amounts to a
high degree of overlap in differentially expressed genes despite the use
of slightly different ages (E13.5 and E14.5) and different technologies
(spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNAseq). We also considered
no fold change threshold, or a threshold of 1, yielding 1066 and 94
genes, respectively. As a final validation, we took the top 50 genes
based on fold-change and p-value for both categories (from both the
spatial transcriptomics and scRNAseq datasets) and compared these
to the GENEPAINT40 database, an in situ hybridization (ISH) high
throughput atlas of ∼15,000 genes (for E14.5 embryos). Out of 100
genes analyzed, 83 exhibited a transmural gradient in the expression
pattern, five did not show a differential pattern, and for 12, the ISH
signal was inconclusive.
To test whether similar transmural gradients exist in the adult heart,
we sampled the left ventricle at three positions, subepicardially (com
pact), mid-ventricle, and subendocardially (trabecular) (even in the
adult heart, the left ventricular free wall has a substantial trabecular
layer41). The latter also contained some ventricular conduction system
cells. When performing differential gene expression analysis on the tra
becular and compact regions of the adult hearts, we found an order of
magnitude fewer differentially expressed genes, 36 genes comprising
only 0.2% of all detected genes (Figure 2B) (no fold change threshold,
36 genes; fold change threshold = 1, 7 genes). The corresponding num
ber of genes for the embryonic hearts were 524, 1066, and 94. This
shows the myocardium of the trabecular and compact layers is much
more different in the embryonic heart compared to the mature heart,
irrespective of the threshold used. Of these genes, at least several
may be attributed to differential tissue composition or inaccuracies
in the segmentation. For example, Hba-a1 and Hbb-b1/2, exclusively
expressed in red blood cells, were enriched in the trabecular samples,
likely due to picking up signal from the blood-filled lumen in between
the trabeculations.
It has been shown that Scn5a, Irx5, and Kcnd2 exhibit transmural
expression gradients in adult mice and rabbit.42,43 Of these, only Scn5a
was found to be significantly differentially expressed, although both
Kcnd2 (unadjusted p-value 0.005) and Irx5 (unadjusted p-value 2.6E-6)
exhibit a trend in the expected direction of enrichment.
When comparing the results of the embryonic and the adult spatial
transcriptomes (Figure 3A), we found very little correlation between
genes differentially expressed in either region between the adult and
the embryonic heart. There are nine genes that are significantly differ
entially expressed in both the adult and embryonic ventricle in either
region, three of these are also significantly expressed in Purkinje cells,
which are derived from a subset of the embryonic trabeculae.44
We also merged the embryonic and adult heart samples and ana
lyzed both together (Figure 3B,C). In the principal component analysis,
the variation between the adult and embryonic samples is mostly rep
resented in principal component 1, which accounts for 86% of the
variance, whereas the second principal component, which accounts for
only 5% of the variance, reflects the separation between the embry
onic compact and trabecular samples. When performing differential
gene expression analysis on the pooled left ventricular samples, we find
that 44.7% of all detected genes are differentially expressed between
the embryo and the adult. Taken together, our spatial analysis indicates
that the transcriptomes of both the embryonic trabecular and compact
myocardium differ substantially from that of the adult ventricular wall,
this difference being much larger than that between the embryonic
trabecular and compact myocardium. Furthermore, the transcriptional
differences between embryonic trabecular and compact myocardium
are not maintained in the adult ventricular wall.
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of human hearts reveals loss of embryonic transmural differences in the adult ventricular myocardium
To assess whether transcriptional differences between the regions and
stages (embryonic versus adult) are conserved in mammals, we rean
alyzed available human single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.24,25 We
used a dataset generated by Asp et al.,24 where the authors performed
single-cell RNA sequencing on a 6.5-week-old embryo (∼3400 cells,
∼470 vCM cells). We could reproduce the results obtained by the
authors, as well as those obtained by Sylvén et al.,45 who also reana
lyzed these same data. We identified clusters belonging to major cell
types, namely, endothelium (CDH5+, NPR3−), endocardium (CDH5+,
NPR3+), epicardium (UPK3B+), as well as ventricular (MYH7) and atrial
(MYH6) cardiomyocytes. Ventricular cardiomyocytes could be clus
tered into the myocardium of the trabecular and compact layer based
on the expression of NPPA and HEY2 (Figure 4A). When performing
differential gene expression analysis, we identified 193 differentially
expressed genes between trabecular and compact (out of 15,323, or
1.3%). By comparing these genes with those we found in the mouse
embryo, we found 76 genes that are differentially expressed (in the

Furthermore, we see the expected trend for 231 genes (Figure 4B,

For the adult human heart, there are many datasets
available.25,46–50 We opted to use the HeartCellAtlas v2, which
was published by Kanemaru et al.,25 because this dataset has a very
clear annotation of many possible confounding factors, and contains
epicardium and endocardium, which implies that fully transmural
samples were used, and thus contains subepicardial compact and
subendocardial trabecular myocardium. During the initial clustering,
performed as described in the previous section, we identified clusters
belonging to endothelium (CDH5+, NPR3−), endocardium (CDH5+,
NPR3+), and epicardium (UPK3B+), and we could also distinguish ven
tricular (MYH7) and atrial (MYL7, MYH6) cardiomyocytes. Within the
ventricular cardiomyocyte cluster, we found four distinct subclusters
(as also found in the original study) indicative of four distinguishable
ventricular cardiomyocyte (vCM) subtypes (Figure 4C, labels vCM1–4).
To investigate whether any of these subtypes more closely resembles
the embryonic compact or trabecular cardiomyocytes, we performed a
cluster analysis on the Z-score of the embryonic and the adult clusters.
We clustered based on the overlapping differentially expressed genes
from the embryonic human and mouse in the trabecular and compact
myocardium, as well as a selection of 300 cardiomyocyte-specific
genes (compiled by using the Seurat function FindMarkers to identify
the differentially expressed genes in cardiomyocytes compared to all
other cell types). None of the four adult vCM subclusters more closely
resemble either the embryonic trabecular or compact cardiomyocyte
cluster. Moreover, the four adult clusters resembled adult atrial
cardiomyocytes (aCMs) more than they resembled embryonic car
diomyocytes (in Figure 4C, compare labels vCM1–4 to adult aCM). This
observation indicates a substantial transformation from embryonic to
adult cardiomyocyte states, suggesting that many maturation-related
changes are shared across cardiomyocyte subtypes. Additionally, the
embryonic trabecular and compact clusters were much more similar to
each other than to any adult cardiomyocyte subcluster. In aggregate,
the substantial differences in transcriptomes of embryonic trabecular
and compact layers have disappeared in the adult ventricle.
Adult zebra finch ventricles show little transcriptional distinction between trabecular and compact myocardium
To evaluate whether differences between the trabecular and com
pact myocardium could be present in birds, we conducted bulk RNA
sequencing on various regions of the adult zebra finch heart. We
detected 15,351 genes with at least 10 counts (out of 22,150 anno
tated genes in the zebra finch reference genome, bTaeGut1_v1). The
genes with the highest gene expression detected were sarcomere and
sarcoplasmic reticulum components, for example, MYH15 (ventricular

from the left ventricular trabecular and compact layer, we find 0.3% of

the 0.3% were NPPB in the trabecular tissue (NPPA is not present in

Fish myocardium exhibits limited differential expression between the trabecular and compact layers of the ventricle
To compare the adult fish ventricle trabecular and compact layers, we
reanalyzed published bulk RNA-sequencing data of the Pacific bluefin
tuna and zebrafish. The zebrafish ventricle consists of mostly trabec
ular myocardium, surrounded by a thin layer of compact muscle. This
ventricular wall design represents the most common type found in
fish. Tuna hearts, on the other hand, have some of the thickest and
proportionally greatest compact layers found in fish.9
Sánchez-Iranzo et al.15 showed in zebrafish that the expression
of tbx5a in the ventricle is restricted to the majority of the trabec
ular layer. Using a reporter line, the authors FACS-purified tbx5a
positive and tbx5a-negative cardiomyocytes, the latter being enriched
in cardiomyocytes from the compact layer, and performed bulk RNA
sequencing. Using the data provided on GEO, we reperformed dif
ferential expression analysis and our results corresponded to those
of the authors.15 We found 84 genes to be differentially expressed
(Figure 7A, p-adjusted <0.05), or 0.6% out of all genes detected. tbx5a,
as expected, was significantly enriched in the trabecular layer. Further
more, we compared the genes found to be differentially expressed in
the zebrafish layers with those found to be differentially expressed in
the embryonic mouse heart layers. This analysis was motivated by the
notion that the embryonic heart of endotherms resembles the heart
of ectotherms.35,56 We found that the genes that were differentially
expressed in the trabecular layer in the mouse corresponded to those
in the trabecular layer of the zebrafish roughly as often as those in
the compact layer of the zebrafish. The same lack of correlation was
observed for the compact layer as well (Figure 7B).
Tunas may have the highest degree of compact myocardium among
fish; perhaps more than half of the total ventricular mass is compact
tissue.9,57 Ciezarek et al.58 performed RNA sequencing on several
different cardiac components of Pacific Bluefin tuna. Their results
showed roughly 2000 genes were differentially expressed between the
atrial and ventricular samples, and our reanalysis revealed 10.1% of
the total number of genes to be differentially expressed between the
atrial and ventricular samples (Figure 8A; 2913 of 28,886 detected
genes, p-adjusted <0.05). These included myh6 in the atrium and myh7
in the ventricle, which in the zebrafish are known markers of those

respective chambers.59 Ciezarek et al.58 found no differentially
expressed genes between the trabecular and compact layers, and
our reanalysis revealed only two genes to be differentially expressed
between the trabecular and the compact layers (Figure 8B). In sum
mary, the myocardium of the ventricular trabecular and compact
layer are almost the same transcriptionally, whereas the atrial and
ventricular myocardium are markedly different.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared transcriptomes of embryonic and adult
trabecular and compact myocardium from five different vertebrate
species. The key finding is that the morphologically distinct ventric
ular trabecular and compact myocardium of adult vertebrates are
transcriptionally similar.
If we assume that transcriptional similarity between the
myocardium of the trabecular and compact layers translates to
comparable functional capacities of the cardiomyocytes of the two
layers, then the relative proportion of trabecular to compact car
diomyocytes in the myocardium may not have much of an impact on
overall ventricular tissue function. This does not rule out the biological
relevance of the compact-to-trabecular myocardium ratio; however,
given the small and inconsistent gene expression differences between
trabecular and compact myocardium across species, we propose that
cardiomyocytes in these layers are unlikely to drive any potential per
formance differences. Should variation in the compact-to-trabecular
ratio substantially impact function, it is not likely to be due to differ
ences in the myocardium per se, but perhaps an emergent feature of
tissue architecture, composition, or environment. However, it is also
possible that adaptations occurring at the organismal level, rather than
those directly pertaining to cardiac function, might drive variations in

the proportion of trabecular to compact myocardium. In this scenario,
the ratio of compact to trabecular could potentially vary more freely
based on adaptations not directly related to cardiac function. Further
more, we need to consider the likely contribution of differences in
cardiomyocyte phenotype between species to differences in cardiac
performance.
With ischemic heart disease being the leading cause of death
worldwide, there is much interest in understanding how the heart
of many ectothermic vertebrates is protected against myocardial
infarction.60,61 This protection indicates that the hearts have a high
proportion of trabecular myocardium where the individual trabecula
tions are so thin that they are homeostatic by exchange by diffusion
with the blood of the chamber cavity. In the mammalian lineage, there
was an evolution away from this infarct-protected setting as most
myocardium became organized in such big aggregates that coronary
perfusion was required for homeostasis. We have proposed previously
that this acquired disadvantage relates to the evolution of large cav
ities which allow for fast filling and ejection from the cavities.5 That
is, mammals evolved a strong predisposition for infarcts via coronary
arterial disease, while gaining a capacity to generate greater cardiac
outputs. In addition, myocardium in large aggregates may accelerate
electrical conduction.5 These two gains are somewhat emergent and
distinct features relative to the identity of the myocardium of the tra
becular and compact layer that we report on here. There are then mul
tiple ways to assess the importance of the extent of trabeculation.62 In
the clinical literature, unfortunately, the myocardium of the trabecular
layer is often considered inferior, somehow, to the myocardium of the
compact layer.63 This could create conundrums where none exist, for
example, when there is an unexpected association between a greater
extent of trabeculation and higher physical activity.64
Previously, Faber et al. reported equivalent force generation poten
tial in cardiomyocytes isolated from the adult mouse trabecular and
compact layers.65 Adult cardiomyocytes of both layers were also able
to generate significantly more force than embryonic cardiomyocytes.
These observations are in line with our current results, together sug
gesting an association between the transcriptomes and functionality
of ventricular cardiomyocytes. That the morphologically distinct tra
becular and compact layers are comprised of phenotypically similar
cardiomyocytes provides an explanation for the observation that the
degree of left ventricular trabeculation does not predict pump function
in humans.6 Myocardial architecture is thought to be functionally rele
vant in fish due to a broad range in the proportion of compact muscle.10
Roberts et al. found that the isometric twitch force of the trabecular
myocardium in steelhead trout was significantly higher than that of the
compact myocardium.66 Although hypoxic acclimation improved the
contractile force of the compact myocardium, it remained lower than
that of the trabecular myocardium.
At least in some fish, then, experimental observations do support
a functional difference between trabecular and compact-organized
myocardium. Hillman and Hedrick,3 however, collated functional data
from a range of vertebrates and demonstrated that total myocardial
mass, irrespective of the underlying ventricular wall morphology, is
strongly correlated to cardiac work. In our assessment, it is likely a gen
eral rule that the myocardium of the trabecular and compact layers is
highly similar in adult animals.
In the embryonic mouse and human hearts, we found a substan
tial number of transcriptional differences between the compact and
trabecular myocardium. Very few genes overlap when comparing the
differentially expressed genes found in embryonic and adult mouse
hearts, and most of the genes that were enriched were in Purkinje
fibers, which are derived from part of the embryonic trabeculations.44
The transcriptional differences between mouse adult and embryonic
left ventricles are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those found
between embryonic compact and embryonic trabecular myocardium.
Similar differences were found when reanalyzing human single-cell
RNA-sequencing data. We can find several adult ventricular cardiomy
ocyte clusters, and in the embryo, we can find distinct trabecular and
compact cardiomyocytes. However, despite their clearly distinct phe
notypes, the embryonic cardiomyocytes resemble each other more
than they resemble any of the adult clusters.
We hypothesize that the phenotypes of cardiomyocytes of the two
layers follow a divergent trajectory during their development, but upon
maturation, both phenotypes converge to acquire molecularly very
similar states while being located in morphologically different struc
tures. It has been suggested that heart cells return to their embryonic
state in high-stress scenarios.67 These findings offer a perspective
on the very substantial scale of changes in gene expression of these
cardiomyocytes that would be required to return heart cells to their
embryonic state. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the gene pro
grams associated with the morphogenetic processes that give rise to
both layers are no longer needed when the structures are formed and
have matured. On the other hand, the expression of most cardiomy
ocyte lineage-enriched genes is initiated during development and
maintained into adulthood. This includes genes differentially expressed
between the embryonic trabecular and compact layers. For example,
Tbx5 and Tbx20, two essential developmental transcription factors dif
ferentially expressed in the embryonic trabecular and compact layer,
respectively,68,69 are required to maintain cardiomyocyte states in the
adult.70,71
In addition to mammals, birds are also endothermic animals. Birds
have a shared ancestry with reptiles, ectothermic animals with a
highly trabeculated heart design, which suggests that birds developed
a compact-dominated heart structure separately after diverging from
reptiles.72 As far as we could assess, the highly trabeculated embryonic
ventricular wall of birds (e.g., chickens) shares gene expression with the
trabeculated embryonic ventricular wall of mammals.73,74 When we
compare the trabecular and compact left ventricle samples from adult
zebra finch hearts, we observe very few differences. Furthermore,
when we examine the right ventricle, which is almost devoid of trabec
ulations, we find a similar number of differences compared to either
left ventricle sample. Had there been differences between trabecular
and compact cardiomyocytes, the compact out-group (right ventricle)
should be more similar to the compact left ventricle samples if signifi
cant differences existed between these regions. The adult zebra finch
heart transcriptomes suggest that, like in mammals, embryonic differ
ences diminish in adulthood, indicating a maturation trajectory and

potential convergent evolution, yet the few observed adult differences
between zebra finches and mice are not similar, indicating a lack of
evolutionary conservation.
In both endothermic groups—mammals and birds—we find minimal
differences between cardiomyocytes in the compact and trabecular
layers of adult hearts. It then seems unlikely that the convergent evo
lution of compact-dominated chamber walls in mammals and birds
reflects a pronounced functional difference of the myocardium of the
compact layer relative to the myocardium of the trabecular layer.
We propose that, if there is a performance difference associated
with the ventricular architecture, the cellular phenotype of the car
diomyocytes of the compact and trabecular myocardium is unlikely to
contribute to this. However, this scenario does not eliminate the pos
sibility that there is relevance to the compact-to-trabecular ratio for
cardiac performance.
Teleost fish belong to the vertebrate clade that exhibits the most
variation in ventricular wall architectures.9,10 The nearly compact-free
heart of the zebrafish and the compact-rich tuna represent extremes of
this variation. Yet, we find there are no differences between the com
pact and trabecular layers of either species. Therefore, the increased
performance of the tuna ventricle may not have much to do with the
relatively high proportion of the compact layer. In contrast, the almost
mammal-like cardiac mass remains an obvious explanation for the
capacity to deliver substantial stroke volumes at mammal-like blood
pressures. The minimal differences observed between trabecular and
compact myocardium, together with no consistent transcriptional dif
ferences across species, suggest that the relationship between the
properties of these two tissue types may be specific to the species
or clade. This perspective has the implications that, first, compar
ing the proportions of trabecular and compact myocardium across
distantly related species may not yield meaningful insight, as these dif
ferences are not conserved. Second, the proportion of trabecular and
compact layers among distant species may reflect the outcomes of dif
ferent selection pressures. Thus, understanding the interplay between
trabecular and compact structures may require a context-specific
approach.
CONCLUSION
The hearts of endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates possess signif
icant physiological differences. Aspects of these differences between
hearts have been attributed to the different chamber wall designs;
however, how these differences in morphology might lead to a differ
ence in performance (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure) has remained
unclear. One way might be that the individual cardiomyocytes found in
the trabecular and compact layers of the hearts are different, in which
case the ratio of trabecular versus compact myocardium of the ven
tricle impacts heart function. We observed that differences between
transcriptomes of trabecular and compact myocardium of adult hearts
of endo- and ectotherms were minimal, suggesting the differences in
phenotype are also small, and are unlikely to contribute to trabecular
compact ratio-dependent differences in heart performance. Other
properties of trabecular or compact myocardium could play a role in
possible performance differences, perhaps differences in mechanical
properties emerge from the difference in tissue organization.
