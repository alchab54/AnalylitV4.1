1 | INTRODUCTION
Perinatal periods are a time when new and expectant parents should
receive support towards health-related behaviours, health preven
tion and coaching to maintain wellness and closeness with infants
(Hantsoo et al., 2018; Hawkins et al., 2019; He et al., 2021; Marko
et al., 2016). Intensive, frequent, quality health behaviour coaching
and counselling of new parents is important during perinatal peri
ods to promote patient engagement and positive perinatal outcomes

Abstract
Background: There is a gap in knowledge about how perinatal eHealth programs
function to support autonomy for new and expectant parents from pursuing wellness
goals.
Objectives: To examine patient engagement (access, personalization, commitment
and therapeutic alliance) within the practice of perinatal eHealth.
Design: Scoping review.
Methods: Five databases were searched in January 2020 and updated in April 2022.
Reports were vetted by three researchers and included if they documented maternity/
neonatal programs and utilized World Health Organization (WHO) person-centred
digital health intervention (DHI) categories. Data were charted using a deductive ma
trix containing WHO DHI categories and patient engagement attributes. A narrative
synthesis was conducted utilizing qualitative content analysis. Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ‘extension for scoping reviews’
guidelines were followed for reporting.
Results: Twelve eHealth modalities were found across 80 included articles. The analy
sis yielded two conceptual insights: (1) The nature of perinatal eHealth programs: (1)
emergence of a complex structure of practice and (2) practising patient engagement
within perinatal eHealth.
Conclusion: Results will be used to operationalize a model of patient engagement
within perinatal eHealth.

Kennelly et al., 2016). Perinatal patients perceive care as satisfac
tory when it is personalized and supports health engagement (Labrie
et al., 2021; Phillippi et al., 2016).
eHealth perinatal care that focuses on involving patients has the
potential to improve quality of care (van den Heuvel et al., 2018).
New models of perinatal care are emerging that show promise for
benefiting perinatal patients, these aim to improve participation
and collaboration between families and professional care provid
ers (de Mooij et al., 2018; Nelson & Holschuh, 2021). Few studies
have investigated how eHealth programs support parents to engage
throughout the entire perinatal continuum. Perinatal care has been
historically fragmented between services for maternity and neo
natal care, which has limited parents' ease in engaging (Molenaar
et al., 2018). Integrated eHealth systems might support the harmoni
zation between maternity and neonatal care programs, which might
be the bridge that leads to more patient participation. Examining pa
tient engagement practices within perinatal eHealth could illuminate
ways for integration of programs that are engaging, personalized and
less fragmented between maternity and neonatal care.
In 2015, the World Bank Group, the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) strongly recommended the ‘use of the digital
revolution to scale up health interventions and engage civil society’
(World Health Organization, 2018). Patient engagement is a bedrock
philosophy for healthcare policy and practice in the United States
of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) (Gibson et al., 2012;
Millenson & Macri, 2012). Financial incentives and support are being
offered for care systems that demonstrate practices of patient
engagement in the USA and UK (Gibson et al., 2012; Millenson &
Macri, 2012). Patient engagement integration into health policy has
been discussed in the last decade; however, the operationalization,
mention of a clear definition and monitoring of patient engage
ment as a structure, process and outcome lack consistency (van den
Heuvel et al., 2018).
2 | BACKGROUND
2.1 | Principles of perinatal patient engagement
The principles of woman- and family-centred care are central to
perinatal care, consider the individual parent and aim for interac
tions between health providers and individuals that promote col
laboration and shared decision-making (Fontein-Kuipers et al., 2018;
Franck & O'Brien, 2019). Patient Engagement is conceptually linked
to woman- and family-centred care. The practices associated with
patient engagement cannot be captured within a single measure or
indicator (Barello et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017; Kelders, van Zyl,
& Ludden, 2020). Higgins et al. (2017) proposed that the meaning of
patient engagement deserved scrutiny, and other researchers pose
that patient engagement is multifactorial and works through struc
tures, processes and behaviours (Higgins et al., 2017; Kelders, Kip, &
Greeff, 2020). In a concept analysis, patient engagement was defined
as both a ‘process and behaviour [that] is shaped by the relationship
between the patient and provider and the environment in which
healthcare delivery takes place’ (Higgins et al., 2017). Four attributes
of patient engagement provide conceptual components for inquiry:
(1) access, (2) personalization, (3) commitment and (4) therapeutic al
liance (Higgins et al., 2017). Access refers to the ability of the patient
to obtain all health resources required to experience high-quality and
appropriate care (Higgins et al., 2017). Personalization assures that
the interventions conform to the unique circumstances of the patient
(Higgins et al., 2017). Commitment is the cognitive and emotional
factors that empower the patient to exploit health resources and
therapeutic alliance represents the elements of the patient–provider
relationship that impact engagement in care (Higgins et al., 2017).
2.2 | Examination of person-centred perinatal eHealth practices
Perinatal eHealth programs have not been examined using clear
definitions of person-centred and patient engagement practices.
Implementation of eHealth interventions in perinatal practice should
begin with the definition of patient engagement and a clear under
standing of person-centred digital health interventions (DHI), as
defined by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2018). WHO clas
sifications of person-centred DHI contain four categories of patient
activities intended to support their health self-management (World
Health Organization, 2018). These four categories lay the fore
ground for person-centred perinatal eHealth and are as follows: (1)
Targeted client communication; (2) client-to-client communication;
(3) personal health tracking and (4) on-demand information services.
If integrating patient engagement into perinatal eHealth is to
meet or exceed the promise as a novel system that supports cur
rent values of person-centred perinatal practice, research needs to
be conducted to examine the nature of perinatal eHealth, and how
the attributes of patient engagement are being practised within pro
grams. Here, this scoping review identifies the nature and range of
person-centred perinatal eHealth and illustrates how the attributes
of patient engagement are practised within these programs. The
research question guiding this review was: What is the nature and
range of perinatal eHealth practice characterized by integration of
the four WHO person-centred DHI categories and patient engage
ment attributes?
3 | METHOD
3.1 | Design
A scoping review was suited for mapping person-centred perina
tal eHealth due to the complexity of this topic (Tricco et al., 2018).
Considering the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the peri
natal eHealth practice we utilized an iterative process for data chart
ing, analysis and synthesis recommended by Daudt et al. (2013) and

endorsed by Pham et al. (2014). The aim of this scoping review was
to develop an understanding of the nature and range of perinatal
eHealth and identify gaps in the research to inform practice, poli
cymaking and future research (Daudt et al., 2013). A systematic ap
proach for this scoping review was further guided by the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (Tricco
et al., 2018).
3.2 | Search strategy
Five electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Eric
and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were
searched in January 2020 and again on April 26th, 2022, to include
all studies up to the end of 2021. We used an expansive list of search
terms to incorporate person-centred perinatal eHealth programs.
See Table 1 for a list of general search terms and keywords. All cita 
tions were exported into RefWorks and Rayyan citation software for
storage, screening and management (Ouzzani et al., 2016).
3.3 | Study selection
All reports included were published in English, had abstracts avail
able, and no date limitations were set for the in original search.
Studies were included that reported on person-centred perinatal
eHealth programs, target users were new or expectant parents,
programs were delivered during pregnancy, 6–8 weeks after birth
(puerperium) and in the case of neonatal care, from birth up to the
time a neonate receives care in neonatal or public health services
(commonly near 44 weeks postmenstrual age). Puerperium has been
defined as 6 weeks after birth (Aisien, 2021); however, inconsisten
cies in reporting this period occur and often range from 6 to 8 weeks
after birth. All programs would contain at least one of the four WHO
patient-centred DHI categories (World Health Organization, 2018).
Studies were not included if the technology was meant to be used
without a two-way interaction between health providers and clients;
the eHealth system was using only outdated forms of telehealth (i.e.
follow-up telehealth phone calls, paging or faxing) or the system was
used solely for diagnostic screening.
3.4 | Data charting
Descriptive characteristics of all included studies were charted by
two researchers (J.A. & H.H.). Descriptive data included:
(1) Author, year and country, (2) Study design, (3) Aim, (4) Target
population and setting, (5) Program structure/devices, (6) WHO
DHI categories, (7) Engagement evaluation and (8) eHealth modal
ities. Deductive and inductive content were charted according to
codebook.
3.5 | Data analysis
Content analysis was performed for examining perinatal eHealth
programs. Our initial codebook consisted of deductive codes related
to access, personalization, commitment and therapeutic alliance and
the four WHO DHI person-centred categories (Higgins et al., 2017;
Kyngäs et al., 2020a; World Health Organization, 2018). We ensured
validity of our codebook development by separating maternity and
neonatal studies, ensuring careful organization and separation of in
ductive meaning units that came from maternity and neonatal pro
grams. eHealth modalities and perinatal treatments were inductively
identified and defined through careful examination of data about the
eHealth programs' structure and device use (Kyngäs et al., 2020b).
Treatment and eHealth modality categories were added to the code
book after consultation with first, third and fourth authors (Kyngäs
et al., 2020b). Next meaning units were identified based on a matrix
of deductive and inductive concepts (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).
The first author extracted meaning units and suggested associated
codes, these were reviewed by the last author for clarity and con
sistency of coding. Codes were developed from condensed meaning
units from maternity and neonatal services separately (Graneheim
& Lundman, 2004). Subcategories were developed from harmoniza
tion of codes, some codes in maternity and neonatal services over
lapped and some remained unique (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).
The latent content of categories was formulated into two main
themes (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). Agreements about interpre
tations of the latent content were made in consultation between the
first, second and fourth authors. The decisions stemming from these
consultations support the fit of the evidence to the final interpreta
tions of latent content (Tavory & Timmermans, 2014, pp. 105–106).

3.6 | Ethics
This study did not require ethical approval or client consent.
4 | RESULTS
4.1 | Study selection
First and third authors reviewed 1555 titles and abstracts indepen 
dently. Full-text review for screening was performed in 257 sources
due to abstract inconsistency. The fourth author and a research as
sistant provided support when agreement was not reached, and 80
sources were selected for review (Maternity n = 58, Neonatal n = 22;
See Figure 1; Page et al., 2021).
4.2 | Study characteristics
Thirty-nine maternity programs and 17 neonatal programs were in
cluded in this review (n = 56). See Table S1 for charted data. Programs
were delivered mainly in North America, the United Kingdom and
Europe (See Table 2). Twelve eHealth modalities (See Figure 2) and 15
different treatments (Figure 3) were used in the programs. Programs
integrated one to four of the WHO DHI person-centred categories
(Table S1). Healthcare providers included nurses, midwives, primary
and special practice doctors, as well as public health, breastfeeding
and co-parenting experts, dieticians, lifestyle coaches and commu
nity health workers. In 53.6% (n = 30) of perinatal programs nurses
were involved in provision of care, program development or re
search activities. All neonatal programs integrated nurses in provi
sion of care, alternatively maternity programs reported nurses’ work
in 16 out of 42 programs (38.1%). Fifteen percent of the studies were
published in recognized nursing journals (Scimago Lab, 2021).
4.3 | The nature of perinatal eHealth programs: Emergence of a complex structure of practice
Perinatal eHealth programs make up a structure of practice that
developed through new interactions and processes mediated by
eHealth modalities. The design and implementation of perinatal
eHealth programs are emerging as the availability of new eHealth
systems (i.e. applications and machine learning-based tailored feed
back), and ubiquitous devices (i.e. smartphones and wearables)
increases. The current generation of new families identifies with
perinatal eHealth (Danbjørg et al., 2015; Gund et al., 2013; Herring
et al., 2019; Soltani et al., 2015). The modality combinations and
use within programs are complex, used for a broad range of person
centred care goals (See Figure 2). All programs are divided according
to maternity or neonatal contexts (See Figure 3).
Programs for supporting parents at home in the care of their
infants were found to be easy to use, relevant and understandable
to users (Abbass-Dick et al., 2017; Danbjørg et al., 2015). In one
case, using an early discharge digital support for parents, a father
was showing nurses how to use the technology and his partner
stated, ‘my boyfriend is technical, so it was [basically] him show 
ing the nurses how it worked’ (Danbjørg et al., 2014). Pregnant
women expressed comfort in using devices and applications that
they could take with them anywhere, to receive information any
time (Himes et al., 2017; Wierckx et al., 2014). Users expressed
wanting to use the programs beyond the study periods and wished
for more harmonized systems throughout the entire perinatal pe
riod (Krishnamurti et al., 2017; Shorey et al., 2018). Most programs
across both maternity and neonatal contexts were focused on a
single care objective.
4.4 | Practising patient engagement within perinatal eHealth
Unique practices related to each attribute of patient engagement
are summarized in Table 3 and described below in a more detailed
narrative synthesis. Access and personalization were integrated into
each program, whereas commitment and therapeutic alliance were
absent from 3 and 8 programs respectively (See Supplementary
Material S4: Table S3).
4.4.1 | Access
Access is practised in programs through the provision of eHealth
modalities that support new opportunities for new or expectant
parents to participate in self-care, health promotion and illness pre
vention. eHealth modalities mediate new interactions that support
the access to appropriate care and potentiate support for increased
knowledge, skill and capacity for self-management of pregnant per
sons' and families' wellness and development.
eHealth programs aimed to give access to on-demand health
information and resources, communication and tailored feedback
intended to support families in building confidence, familiarity,
knowledge and awareness in health promotion and illness preven
tion activities (Banerjee et al., 2020; Baron et al., 2018; Cramer
et al., 2018; Doherty et al., 2019; Fontein-Kuipers et al., 2016;
Shorey et al., 2018; Spargo & Vries, 2018; Strand et al., 2021;
Wierckx et al., 2014). Patients had more convenient communica
tion experiences with their health professionals, timely information
through feedback and self-monitoring modalities, and could lead
content and timing of communication (Dalton et al., 2018; Doherty
et al., 2019; Herring et al., 2019; Holm et al., 2019). Medical and
non-medical issues were brought to the forefront of the maternity
patients' minds through access to information and communica
tion (Carrilho et al., 2019; de Mooij et al., 2018; Himes et al., 2017;
Krishnamurti et al., 2017; O'Brien et al., 2013; Soltani et al., 2015).

short message service (SMS) (Globus et al., 2016), and infant care
and collaboration training using education and coaching applications
(Banerjee et al., 2020; Platonos et al., 2018). Women and their fam
ilies received new access to the care team from remote locations
which supported timely appropriate care, in many cases from the
comfort of their own homes (Doherty et al., 2020; Garne et al., 2016;
Gund et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2019; Payakachat et al., 2020; Shorey
et al., 2018; Strand et al., 2021; Triebwasser et al., 2020).

4.4.2 | Personalization
User-centred program design practices supported personalization.
eHealth practices included the provision of personal care experi
ences that were founded on woman-and family-centred approaches.
Personalization practices encompass tailored, on-demand, flexible
programs and consider new and expectant parents' preferences,
needs, values and diversity.
Programs were very often designed using a participatory de
sign (PD), or user-centred design model. Involving key stakeholders
(e.g. professional, informal caregivers and patients) in the design of
eHealth programs was seen to encourage engagement and sustain
able uptake of perinatal programs (Danbjørg et al., 2015; Payakachat
et al., 2020; Strand et al., 2021). One research team in Canada de
veloped a way of recording interactions with the C-Care applica
tion throughout real-time testing and modified the program during
testing to accommodate higher interaction with the system (Ke
et al., 2021). Functions included automated text messages personal
ized to the individual's unique circumstances, which supported core
woman-and family-centred concepts such as reciprocity, tailored
care and shared decision-making (Danbjørg et al., 2015; Doherty
et al., 2020). Users expressed that having understandable, individual
ized, relevant and timely information met their support needs during
pregnancy, labouring at home and in early days at home with their
infants (de Mooij et al., 2018; Frize et al., 2013; Gibson et al., 2021;
O'Brien et al., 2013; Ridgeway et al., 2015; Willcox et al., 2015; Yee
et al., 2021). One woman described that she felt a personal care ex
perience while using remote foetal monitoring system at home, be
cause nurses could see what was happening on their own monitors
and coordinate with her at a distance (O'Brien et al., 2013). While
parents using an Application to support early discharge home after
birth found that staying home and getting timely answers to their
questions using remote communication had a positive impact on
their affinity within the family (Danbjørg et al., 2015).
4.4.3 | Commitment
Commitment is practised in programs through integration of behav
ioural change and self-efficacy theories during the development and
design (See Supplement Material S3: Table S2). eHealth modalities

involved in their own care processes. Commitment was also prac
tised through the supporting of new ways to coach and connect
with patients. Lastly, new interactions mediated by eHealth modali
ties supported new processes of becoming committed to self and
newborn care.
Perinatal eHealth programs change the face of connectivity and
coaching for new or expectant parents. Tailored alerts and informa
tion sharing directed to the personal handheld devices of patients
changes their capacity to interact as members of the care teams
(Choi et al., 2015; Danbjørg et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2018; Frize
et al., 2013; Herring et al., 2019). eHealth patients have a chance
to view information and their own personal health data and trends
on demand (Abbass-Dick et al., 2017; Isetta et al., 2013; Valencia
et al., 2020; van der Wulp et al., 2014). These opportunities are me
diated by eHealth modalities such as tailored feedback, decision
making supports, digital log keeping and self-monitoring. Perinatal
patients can participate in shared decision-making with new con
fidence and receive contact and coaching when and where they
would like it (Danbjørg et al., 2015; de Mooij et al., 2018). Meaningful
involvement in perinatal care processes was a motivating factor
for many perinatal patients. They could look at their own personal
trends, record and report their findings (i.e. for newborn assess
ment or pregnancy weight gain or blood pressures) and support
care decisions and goal setting with their professional care givers
(Davis et al., 2018; Dougall et al., 2020; Garfield et al., 2016; Isetta
et al., 2013; Rhoads et al., 2017).
Perinatal patients experienced becoming committed for self
and newborn care enabled through new interactions mediated by
eHealth modalities. Maternity programs supported motivation for
behaviour changes through interactive tools, and feedback, as was
seen in Doherty and colleagues ‘ideas machine’ a feedback system
that used user input about preferences and experiences to deliver
tailored tips for achieving goals for mental wellness in the moment
(Doherty et al., 2019). Parents of newborns were able to become
committed to learning and practising their new roles when just re
turning from hospital with access to on-demand information and re
sources that were provided in many formats, instructional videos,
links to go deeper on topics, and pages they could ‘favourite’ for
reading later (Danbjørg et al., 2015; Garfield et al., 2016; Isetta
et al., 2013; Shorey et al., 2018; Strand et al., 2021).
4.4.4 | Therapeutic alliance
Perinatal eHealth practices that integrate therapeutic alliance en
compass new provider–patient interactions, and eHealth-driven
emotional and lifesaving supportive activities. eHealth components
are seen as partners in care, and the fostering of teamwork through
remote communication are important features from the patients'
perspective. Therapeutic alliance is supported through consider
ation for the integration of eHealth modalities into workflows, and
eHealth policies.
Therapeutic alliance is practised through considering policy
and physical infrastructure and staff attitudes, and capacity to
use eHealth modalities as guiding factors for successful imple
mentation of new eHealth practices (Banerjee et al., 2020; Baruth
et al., 2019; Bower et al., 2005; Dalton et al., 2018; Danbjørg
et al., 2015; Doherty et al., 2020; Frize et al., 2013; Globus
et al., 2016; Herring et al., 2019; Jefferson et al., 2019; Strand
et al., 2021; Triebwasser et al., 2020; Wierckx et al., 2014). Self
monitoring and sharing of data to aid in collaborative clinical inter
pretations and decision-making emerged as new patient–provider
interactive processes. Some perinatal patients used data to guide
conversations, and other times clinicians were triggered through
the automated systems to contact patients because of concern
ing data or events (i.e. abnormal blood pressure readings or men
tal health alerts) (Hantsoo et al., 2018; Krishnamurti et al., 2017;
O'Brien et al., 2013; Rhoads et al., 2017; Strand et al., 2021).
Self-monitoring and remote communication modalities medi
ated lifesaving and emotional support provision by professional
caregivers at a distance (Doherty et al., 2020; Holm et al., 2019;
Jefferson et al., 2019; Ledford et al., 2017; Marko et al., 2016;
Rhoads et al., 2017; Strand et al., 2021). Perinatal eHealth pa
tients explained that they felt companionship with some eHealth

components, with one women saying that the eHealth program
was the ‘only person in [her] life who asked...how [she] was doing
everyday’ (Krishnamurti et al., 2017). Interactions between peri
natal patients and the eHealth modalities provided new forms of
support to supplement face-to-face visits (Banerjee et al., 2020;
Danbjørg et al., 2015; Doherty et al., 2020; Herbec et al., 2014;
Himes et al., 2017; Hirshberg et al., 2018; Holm et al., 2019;
Ledford et al., 2017; Shorey et al., 2018; Soltani et al., 2015; Strand
et al., 2021; van der Wulp et al., 2014; Yee et al., 2021).
5 | DISCUSSION
5.1 | Principal results
This is the first review to bring together perinatal eHealth programs,
treatments and modalities, with the aim of describing the range of
practices and conceptualizing the nature of perinatal person-centred
eHealth. Perinatal eHealth programs in the developed world make up
a structure of practice that contains person-centred eHealth modal
ities and separates care between maternity and neonatal practices.
Nursing leadership might be lacking in the structure development
and process evaluation of perinatal eHealth due to the high per
centage of studies and programs that are not reporting on nursing
expertise. Access and personalization are being practised in all peri
natal eHealth programs, and commitment and therapeutic alliance
are lacking in a 19.6% (n = 11) of all programs. Findings from this re
view reveal that person-centred and patient engagement practices
are being used within the current structure; however, development
and design of these programs lack harmonization between maternity
and neonatal care, and consistency of commitment and therapeutic
alliance practices.
5.2 | The nature of perinatal eHealth programs
A summary of the programs captured in this scoping review illus
trates that perinatal eHealth is being provided across various peri
natal treatments; from health promotion and symptom management
in pregnancy, to parental skill development in caring for, breastfeed
ing and monitoring infants and supporting parental-infant closeness
(See Figure 3). No programs have harmonized maternity and neo
natal treatments across the continuum of the perinatal period into
a single eHealth program. A structure of siloed care has been per
sistent in perinatal care programs internationally due to the grow
ing complexity and specialization of services (Liu, 2016; Molenaar
et al., 2020). Uncoordinated services have led to low engagement
by families (Molenaar et al., 2018). Research has revealed that new
and expectant parents desire an expanded integrated service that
supports easy navigation and a smoother continuity of care through
out their perinatal journeys (Abbass-Dick et al., 2017; Danbjørg
et al., 2015; Garne Holm et al., 2017; Himes et al., 2017; Liu, 2016;
Wierckx et al., 2014). Our findings reveal that although eHealth
programs could provide a system for harmonizing maternity and
neonatal care programs this potential has not yet been harnessed.
A lot has been learned about how to integrate numerous eHealth
modalities into routine and common perinatal care processes (i.e.
management and monitoring of gestational diabetes and hyper
tension; and supporting parent participation in the care of a sick
neonate). Programs included in this review have innovated clin
ical care practices to include eHealth modalities with the aim of
improving patient satisfaction, health and clinical outcomes. The
WHO recommends clearly articulating how technology will ad
dress specific person-centred health system problems, such as poor
patient experience and delayed provision of care (World Health
Organization, 2018). Therefore, the WHO person-centred digital
health interventions being implemented by each perinatal eHealth
program in this review could be more clearly identified by research
ers in the future to support better understanding of the usefulness
of eHealth innovation towards solving person-centred health sys
tem challenges. In combination with this nursing-led research about
perinatal eHealth practice and program development should be con
sidered. Exemplary nursing leadership has been found to positively
impact on structural outcomes for quality care, supports common
visions and goals for care among staff and promotes effective in
formation sharing (Cook & Leathard, 2004; Kiwanuka et al., 2021;
Sfantou et al., 2017).
5.3 | Practising patient engagement within perinatal eHealth
5.3.1 | Access
Access has been identified as a precondition for patient engagement
(Kelders, van Zyl, & Ludden, 2020) and as a metric that should be
considered when examining the presence of patient engagement
within eHealth programs (Barello et al., 2016). Our review expands
on this by illustrating that practices of access provide opportunities
for developing partnerships at a distance and allow for new partici
pation in perinatal care processes. Pregnant persons and families
can integrate perinatal practices into their daily lives. New access
can lead to care approaches that connect providers with patients in
their natural settings. This has provided relief to parents who find
it hard to make the trips to medical offices, and balances power dy
namics as providers are assessing families in their own home envi
ronments through video conferencing (Lieu et al., 2021). Pregnant
persons monitor their own goals for health-related behaviours with
out waiting to have important assessments and collation of lifestyle
pattern data during antenatal clinic visits (Naughton et al., 2013;
van der Wulp et al., 2014). Research about self-monitoring has sug
gested that self-care activities might introduce increased burden
related to worry and stress (Auxier et al., 2023; Mol, 2018, p.19).
Further study should be conducted on the nature of care processes
occurring at home from a variety of perspectives and user groups.
Perinatal eHealth practitioners should also consider tailoring the

level of access provided and the amount of engagement that suites
each client when using eHealth programs.
5.3.2 | Personalization
In this review, eHealth modalities were mechanized for personali
zation practices, and user-centred design of programs contributed
to the integration of personalization from a development perspec
tive. Past literature shows that perinatal services do not always
support women and families' expectations for personalized care
(Auxier, 2017; Platonos et al., 2018). This scoping review reveals that
eHealth modalities mediate new personal care experiences. By using
eHealth modalities purposefully for the sustainment of person
centred care, and the tailoring of care journeys to unique patients
some of the persistent challenges with enabling person-centred care
might be combated. Patient involvement was common in programs
from this review and in line with the best practice recommendation
of ensuring stakeholder involvement in eHealth program design
(Oberschmidt et al., 2022).
5.3.3 | Commitment
Our findings reveal that consistency in the use of process measures
to guide evaluation of commitment and participation within perina
tal eHealth programs is lacking. Process evaluation, also described
as process monitoring by the WHO is needed for collecting and ana
lysing data to understand how well our programs are meeting the
aims of care (World Health Organization, 2016). Commitment can
be measured through behaviour and cognition, as seen in Kelders,
Kip, and Greeff (2020) measure, Twente Engagement with Ehealth
Technologies Scale (TWEETS). Neonatal eHealth person-centred
practices that support commitment can be evaluated by using a
newly developed process evaluation measure, the CO-PARTNER
tool (van Veenendaal et al., 2021). More process measures could be
developed in the future to guide the monitoring of perinatal eHealth
user engagement and care processes related to commitment as
these are not being consistently reported in the scientific literature.
This scoping review highlights the potential to monitor behavioural
engagement and participation over time using digital log keeping and
ecological momentary assessment modalities.
5.3.4 | Therapeutic alliance
Therapeutic alliance sets patient engagement as a concept apart from
others such as empowerment, and involvement (Higgins et al., 2017).
While there has been a plethora of knowledge accumulated about
collaboration and connectedness between perinatal care providers
and their clients, very little is known about how therapeutic alliance
is enacted within perinatal eHealth programs. Our findings illustrated
that in 12.5% of programs therapeutic alliance practices were not
reported. Current research shows that increased connectivity can
aid in collaboration and continuity of perinatal care and our review
highlights which functionalities help to enact these practices. More
purposeful inquiry into this attribute of patient engagement would
support deeper understandings of the nuanced interactions between
patients, providers and eHealth modalities. All care begins with build
ing trust, this is being investigated in relation to face-to-face peri
natal practice (Korstjens, 2021; Wreesmann et al., 2021); however,
researchers and clinicians need to appreciate the importance of in
vestigating how trust is built with eHealth systems as a partner-in
care. Person-centred eHealth modalities are helping to bring relevant,
personal and timely resources, information, and support to perinatal
clients and help to provide safer transition from hospital to home. In
the wake of a revolution in perinatal practice, providers need to be
supported to interact with eHealth systems in ways that enhance and
support the co-creation of therapeutic alliances.
5.4 | Implications for nursing research and practice
This review demonstrates a synthesis of knowledge from many dis
ciplines. From this, we have a diversity of perspectives that provides
a shared understanding of the range and nature of perinatal eHealth.
However, nursing inquiry and practice are scarce in the literature
related to maternity eHealth practice, neonatal literature has inte
grated nursing expertise and inquiry to a larger extent. Although
multidisciplinary work is of high importance, nursing knowledge
and inquiry are lacking in the research and development of services
overall. Health Science literature indicates that nursing and mid
wifery inquiry is integral to the development, implementation and
evaluation of eHealth resource use in perinatal services (Richardson
et al., 2018). More collaborative research should be conducted that
combines user design theory with nursing science perspectives.
Findings from our review illustrate that eHealth modalities sup
port women and families towards accessible, and personalized health
service, eHealth modalities should be paired with relational nursing
approaches (Korstjens, 2021; Stelwagen et al., 2020). Commitment
and therapeutic alliance integration within perinatal eHealth fulfils
perinatal nursing practice goals of woman- and family-centred care;
parent–infant closeness and health-related behaviour promotion in
pregnancy (Fontein-Kuipers et al., 2018; Franck & O'Brien, 2019;
van den Heuvel et al., 2018). In this review, we recommend priori
tizing defining and implementing commitment and therapeutic alli
ance interventions within perinatal eHealth as this will support more
clarity for nursing practitioners working towards evidence-based
practices (EBP).
5.5 | Limitations and strengths
While this scoping review provides a new entry point in which to
discuss and appreciate perinatal eHealth, the nature of terminology
usage in the available publications is inconsistent and we suspect
20541058, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nop2.1822 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [15/07/2025].

AUXIER et al.
some sources have been missed due to the complexity and interdis
ciplinary nature of the literature. Key terms were not used to capture
pregnancy experiences of person's not identifying as women, (i.e.
trans, trans/masculine and non-binary and transgender). Future re
views discussing perinatal care should include this group, to better
identify the level of their involvement in perinatal eHealth evalua
tion. Further, this work is limited in its form as a scoping review and
the level of evidence cannot be evaluated as such. We attended to
credibility through careful consideration of suitable meaning units
that were based on definitions of patient engagement attributes
and WHO digital service person-centred categories (Graneheim &
Lundman, 2004). Transferability can be judged through our clear
descriptions of the practice structure context and presentation of
findings (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). We suggest avenues for
perinatal eHealth implementation, clinical practice and policy con
siderations and future research based on descriptions of the nature
and range of perinatal eHealth and current knowledge gaps.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
Perinatal eHealth is emerging as a complex and potentially harmo
nized practice, the next generations of new families demand access
to personalized, relevant, stimulating, integrated and connected
perinatal care. To date, current evaluations of perinatal eHealth pro
grams have been mainly focused on satisfaction of care, feasibility and
medical-based patient outcomes. Process evaluation and purposeful
eHealth program development should be carried out more commonly
in the future and can incorporate more nursing perspectives. Based
on the findings from this review, access and personalization are being
practised in all included programs, but therapeutic alliance and com
mitment can be reported more often. The integration of all attributes
is important for embedding core values of person-centred perinatal
care into practice. The next steps stemming from this review are to
conduct an interpretive synthesis to inform a patient engagement
model for perinatal eHealth development and quality assurance.
