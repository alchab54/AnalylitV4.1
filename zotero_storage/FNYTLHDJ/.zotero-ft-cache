Populations with common physical diseases – such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders – experience substantially higher rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) than the general population. On the other hand, people living with MDD have a greater risk for many physical diseases. This high level of comorbidity is associated with worse outcomes, reduced adherence to treatment, increased mortality, and greater health care utilization and costs. Comorbidity can also result in a range of clinical challenges, such as a more complicated therapeutic alliance, issues pertaining to adaptive health behaviors, drug-drug interactions and adverse events induced by medications used for physical and mental disorders. Potential explanations for the high prevalence of the above comorbidity involve shared genetic and biological pathways. These latter include inflammation, the gut microbiome, mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and brain structure and function. Furthermore, MDD and physical diseases have in common several antecedents related to social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status), lifestyle variables (e.g., physical activity, diet, sleep), and stressful live events (e.g., childhood trauma). Pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are effective treatments for comorbid MDD, and the introduction of lifestyle interventions as well as collaborative care models and digital technologies provide promising strategies for improving management. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of the epidemiology of the comorbidity of MDD and specific physical diseases, including prevalence and bidirectional risk; of shared biological pathways potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and common physical diseases; of socio-environmental factors that serve as both shared risk and protective factors; and of management of MDD and physical diseases, including prevention and treatment. We conclude with future directions and emerging research related to optimal care of people with comorbid MDD and physical diseases.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent within the gen eral population, with an approximate global point prevalence of 4.7%1. In populations with common physical diseases – such as cardiovascular diseases2,3, cancer4 and neurodegenerative disor ders58 – this prevalence is much higher, with several meta analyses reporting MDD rates of up to 41% in selected physical diseases28 . This relationship is often bidirectional, with both observational and some Mendelian randomization studies demonstrating that MDD and physical diseases can be predictors and outcomes of each oth er914 .
There are a range of potential explanations for the high level of comorbidity between MDD and physical diseases1518 . Shared ge netic and biological pathways suggest that there are numerous pathological mechanisms implicated in both MDD and physical diseases that may increase risk or exacerbate comorbidity15,16. Fur thermore, there are several shared antecedent social, lifestyle and life event risk factors for MDD and physical diseases17,18. In addi tion, factors precipitated by one disease can increase the risk of another. For example, motivational impairments present in MDD
may affect the ability to exercise and maintain a healthy diet, re sulting in an increased risk of physical diseases. The consequences of this high level of comorbidity are far reach ing, with evidence supporting worse outcomes19, reduced adher ence to treatment20, increased mortality21, and increased health care utilization and costs2226 . MDD poses a substantial disease burden, ranking second among leading causes of years lived with disability according to the Global Burden of Disease Study27. Using data from the Danish registry and previously published methods28, more than one third of the total nonfatal burden (34.4%) in people with MDD was due to comorbid physical diseases, such as respira tory diseases (e.g., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis order), pain related conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and gas trointestinal disorders. Comorbidity of MDD and physical diseases also introduces sev eral clinical challenges that are often not apparent within the published literature, in which clinical populations can be highly selected. These include a higher prevalence of other mediating or moderating disorders such as substance abuse and personality dis

orders, a more complicated therapeutic alliance, issues pertaining to adaptive health behaviors29, drug drug interactions and adverse events induced by medications used for physical and mental dis eases. This paper draws on meta analyses and Mendelian random ization studies, as well as on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where appropriate, to provide a detailed, up to date overview of: a) the epidemiology of the comorbidity of MDD and physical dis eases, including prevalence and bidirectional risk; b) shared bio logical pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and phys ical diseases, c) socio environmental factors that serve as shared risk and protective factors; d) clinical management of MDD and physical diseases, including considerations regarding prevention and treatment; and e) future directions and emerging research re lated to optimal care of people with comorbid MDD and physical diseases. While this review focuses on, and primarily refers to, MDD and its relation to physical diseases, it is also informed by evidence concerning closely related constructs, such as elevated depressive symptoms, as well as by studies that investigate depression but have not used formalized DSM 5/ICD 11 diagnoses of MDD. Fur thermore, we use the term “physical diseases” throughout to refer
to non psychiatric and non communicable diseases discussed in the review. We do, however, acknowledge that this is an imperfect definition, as MDD itself can also be considered a physical disease with well observed physical mechanisms (as discussed in the pa per) and clinical manifestations.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE COMORBIDITY OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND SPECIFIC PHYSICAL DISEASES
In this section, we provide an overview of the association be tween MDD and specific physical diseases as emerging from meta analytic data. MDD has been identified as a risk factor for several physical dis eases (see Figure 1), with much evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship. We explore this further using results from Mendelian randomization studies, which use genetic variation as a natural experiment to investigate the causal relations between potentially modifiable risk factors and health outcomes30. This method is argu ably less susceptible to known limitations of observational studies such as confounding or reverse causation30, thus complementing

the extensive observational literature in this area. MDD is also highly prevalent in a range of physical diseases (see Figure 2), with an approximate mean aggregate point prevalence of 25%. While this is higher than the general population1,31, meta
analyses that have synthesized prevalence estimates often report high heterogeneity (with I2 typically higher than 90%)3234 , suggest ing that prevalence is highly variable. The influence of factors such as disease stage, severity, setting (e.g., hospital vs. community), tim

ing (e.g., immediate vs. years after disease onset), measurement methods (e.g., self report, clinical diagnosis, clinician rating), and definition of MDD used (e.g., clinical cut offs vs. elevated symp toms) in determining these estimates should be considered. Such factors are explored in the following disease specific sections.
Cardiovascular diseases
The point prevalence of MDD after myocardial infarction is re ported to be 28.7%, while it is 17.7% after stroke33,35. Prevalence rates of MDD are influenced by the severity of the comorbid dis ease36. For example, in people with heart failure, MDD rates range from 11% in people with less functional impairment (class 1 ac cording to the New York Heart Association) to 42% in those with se vere impairment (class 4)36. Many guidelines and position statements, such as those of the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiol ogy2,37, consider MDD a potentially modifiable risk factor for car diovascular diseases. Indeed, several meta analyses of prospective cohort studies have reported that baseline MDD increases the risk of future cardiovascular events3841 . While previous meta analyses
have raised concerns regarding a variety of potential confounders39, a recent meta analysis of Danish registry cohorts that accounted for these confounders reported that MDD diagnosis was associated with higher risk of subsequent ischemic heart disease (hazard ra tio, HR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.36 1.95) and stroke (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.63 2.30)11. On the other hand, baseline ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.43 2.23) and stroke (HR: 2.62, 95% CI: 2.09 3.29) were associated with subsequent MDD, demonstrating a bidirectional relationship11. Recent Mendelian randomization studies have indicated that the genetic liability for MDD is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (odds ratio, OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.10 1.43)42, small vessel stroke (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.08 1.65)43, and myocardial infarction (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07 1.23)44, while there is a null association between genetic liability for cardiovascular diseases and subsequent increased MDD risk (see Figure 3)42 44. In people with cardiovascular diseases and stroke survivors, MDD is associated with increased health care costs and unplanned rehospitalizations23,25, an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and chest pain2, and a significant decrease in quality of life45,46. Further more, MDD occurring after a cardiovascular event is associated with poorer adherence to treatments and adaptive lifestyle changes20,

including attendance and completion of rehabilitation47, which improves after resolution of depressive symptoms48.
Diabetes mellitus
The point prevalence of MDD is high in both type 1 (22%) and type 2 (19%) diabetes mellitus32. People with MDD have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (risk ratio, RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12 1.24)49 and people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of MDD (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02 1.30)50. Previous meta analyses of prospective cohort studies suggest a bidirectional association between MDD and type 2 diabetes. However, recent Mendelian randomization studies sug gest a unidirectional relationship, with genetic liability for MDD as sociated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes42,51. Comorbid MDD in people with type 2 diabetes is associated with poorer adherence to diabetes treatment52 and self care activities (e.g., exercise, healthy eating)53,54, increased health care costs22,54, reduced glycemic control55,56, and increased hospital admissions and complications5760 . A recent meta analysis reported that base line MDD is associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes related complications (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07 1.21)57. The risk of functional disability is also substantially increased in people with comorbid MDD and diabetes compared to individuals with one dis ease58. Furthermore, comorbid MDD and diabetes may increase the risk of other physical diseases59. For example, a prospective study reported that individuals with diabetes and comorbid MDD had an increased risk of dementia (HR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.77 4.07) compared to individuals with diabetes only41,59.
Metabolic syndrome
The metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance, central obe sity, impaired glucose tolerance, raised triglycerides, reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non alcoholic fatty liver dis ease, and hypertension61. It is a major risk factor for developing both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as for prema ture mortality62. There is a bidirectional association between MDD and the meta bolic syndrome. People with MDD are 1.38 (95% CI: 1.17 1.64) times more likely than the general population to develop the metabolic syndrome63, while people with the metabolic syndrome are 1.49 (95% CI: 1.20 1.87) times more likely to develop MDD10. This asso ciation exists in both adults and older people64. However, a Mende lian randomization study suggests that genetically predicted MDD is positively associated with the risk of the metabolic syndrome, but that genetically predicted metabolic syndrome is not associated with the risk of MDD65. Individual components of the metabolic syndrome, such asobe sity, may also have a bidirectional association with MDD. Meta analyses of prospective observational studies report that baseline MDD increases the risk of developing obesity (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.17 1.48), and baseline obesity increases the risk of onset of future
MDD (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04 1.35)66. However, several recent Men delian randomization studies have shown that genetically predict ed increased body mass index and fat mass are associated with an increased risk of MDD, while the reverse is not true6770 . Emerging studies also suggest that the metabolic profile can in fluence the association between obesity and MDD, with a recent meta analysis of cross sectional studies reporting that metabol ically unhealthy obesity was associated with a 30% to 83% increased risk of MDD, whereas obesity with a favorable metabolic profile was not associated with an increase of that risk71. Furthermore, one co hort study found that, while the metabolic syndrome overall was not associated with the resolution of MDD symptoms, abnormal cir culating triglycerides and cholesterol were associated with a lower likelihood of symptom resolution72. This is in keeping with another small case control study which found an association between low HDL cholesterol and poorer MDD prognosis73.
Cancer
Large meta analyses have estimated the point prevalence of MDD in people with cancer to be around 21%4,74,75. However, this estimate is highly variable depending on a range of factors related to disease course (e.g., early vs. advanced stages), treatment time point (acute treatment vs. survivorship), and assessment method (selfreported or clinical diagnosis) 4,74,75. A previous meta analysis demonstrated that prevalence rates of MDD are generally highest during the acute phases of the disease and during treatment (estimates between 14% and 27%)4. Preva lence rates at 2 and 5 year post treatment generally return to simi lar estimates as the general population or healthy controls76,77. Previous meta analyses and large cohort studies have also iden tified that the prevalence of MDD can substantially vary based on cancer type7880 . While there is some inconsistency between studies, hematological, gastrointestinal, lung and gynecological cancers are often identified as having a higher MDD prevalence compared to other types of cancer7880 . A large number of factors have been associated with a greater risk of MDD in people with cancer81. A recent systematic review identified a range of somatic (e.g., advanced cancer stage, comor bidities, pain), sociodemographic (e.g., female gender), social (e.g., low socioeconomic status, impaired social support), and psychi atric (e.g., previous history of MDD) factors that were commonly associated with increased MDD risk. Pre existing MDD and per sonality factors such as neuroticism were the most consistently as sociated81. MDD may modestly increase the risk of cancer onset and mor tality. A recent meta analysis reported that MDD and anxiety were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer incidence (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 1.19) and cancer specific mortality (RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.16 1.26)82. These estimates are similar to a previous meta analysis that examined MDD separately from anxiety83,84. Mendelian randomization studies suggest that genetically pre dicted MDD is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02 1.17), but not of a range of other can

cer types85,86. Some studies have also reported that MDD may predict lower T cell cytokine expression and reduce treatment adherence or initiation87,88, while improvement in depressive symptoms has been associated with increased survival in people with cancer89.
Neurological diseases
MDD is associated with multiple neurological diseases. Meta analytic evidence from longitudinal studies indicates that MDD is a meaningful risk factor for future Alzheimer’s disease (RR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.522.38) 90, all cause dementia (RR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.59 2.43)90, vascular dementia (RR: 2.71, 95% CI: 2.48 2.97)90, and Parkinson’s disease (RR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.87 2.58)91. Some authors suggest that MDD may be considered a prodrome of these neurological dis eases92. Mendelian randomization studies provide further support to a unidirectional association for some neurological diseases, but not all. Genetically predicted MDD is a risk factor for Parkinson’s dis ease and epilepsy, while there is no evidence for genetically pre dicted neurological diseases being a risk factor for MDD93,94. Two Mendelian randomization studies provided contrasting results for MDD and Alzheimer’s disease95,96, and two studies found no association between genetically predicted MDD and multiple scle rosis97,98. Metaanalyses and reviews indicate an overall high point prev alence of MDD in Parkinson’s disease (38%)34, epilepsy (22.9%)5, migraine (up to 47.9%)99, multiple sclerosis (30.5%)6, mild cognitive impairment (32%)7, and Alzheimer’s disease (41%)8. MDD is con sistently associated with reduced quality of life across several neu rological diseases100, as well as with increased disability and poorer functioning. For example, MDD is associated with increased sei zure frequency in people with epilepsy and excessive daytime sleep iness in Parkinson’s disease101,102. Furthermore, MDD increases the risk for progression and chro nicity103105 . For example, the presence of depressive symptoms is associated with faster progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease104. A separate study reported similar results for migraine, where depressive symptoms dose dependently in creased the risk of progression from episodic to chronic disease105.
Osteoporosis
A growing body of evidence shows that MDD is associated with poor bone health106109 . A meta analysis pooling the results of 21 cross sectional studies involving 1,842 participants with MDD and 17,401 controls found that MDD was associated with lower bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femur and total hip, with small to medium effect sizes110. A separate meta analysis also reported that MDD was prospec tively associated with an increased annual bone loss rate of 0.35% (95% CI: 0.18 0.53), and a 39% increased risk of fracture (RR:1.39, 95% CI: 1.19 1.62)106. Complicating this, the use of selective sero tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is independently associated with osteoporosis107.
A recent Mendelian randomization analysis failed to substanti ate these findings, reporting that a genetic predisposition towards MDD showed no effect on bone mineral density or fracture risk, concluding that reverse causality or residual confounding may be at play108. In support to these latter data, there is some evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increased in those with osteoporo sis, with a recent meta analysis reporting that 23% of older adults with osteoporosis also reported MDD109. MDD is also commonfol lowing fractures, likely due to associated pain and reduced func tional status111.
Mortality
While both MDD and several physical diseases are associated with independent increases in mortality, their coexistence com pounds this risk. For example, a prospective analysis using the UK Biobank (N=499,830) reported that both MDD (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19 1.33) and diabetes mellitus (HR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.52 1.72) inde pendently increased the risk of mortality; however, the presence of both conditions amplified that risk (HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.94 2.42)112. Furthermore, a recent umbrella review found that MDD increased all cause or cardiovascular related mortality in patients with sev eral physical diseases (i.e., heart failure, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus)113. The associations between MDD and all cause mortality among pop ulations with cancer, post acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure showed the strongest level of evidence113. There is also evi dence that increasing levels of psychological distress can confer
greater risk of premature death owing to cardiovascular diseases
114.
Research using Danish registers and the recently introduced life years lost metric115 examined the overall reduction in life expectan cy associated with MDD, and explored how different types of physi cal diseases contribute to this premature mortality21. Overall, men and women with MDD lost 8.27 (95% CI: 8.10 8.47) and 6.40 (95% CI: 6.25 6.55) years of life respectively, compared to age and sex matched controls from the general population. The co occurrence of a mood disorder such as MDD and substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder) had a substantial further impact on prema ture mortality, with an additional ~6 years lost116. The contribution of comorbid cardiovascular disease to premature mortality in those with MDD was comparable in men and women (~1 year), while res piratory diseases accounted for further 0.71 and 0.99 years lost in men and in women respectively.
COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric sequalae
A global 27.6% (95% CI: 25.1 30.3) increase in MDD prevalence due to the COVID 19 pandemic has been estimated117, although this finding remains controversial118. The long term psychiatric and physical disease consequences of the infection or “Long CO VID” are currently unclear and an area of emerging research119,120. Long COVID has been associated with new onset of a range of physical diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes)120.

There also appears to be an increased risk of MDD as well as other mental disorders121. However, this risk may be transient and similar to non COVID severe respiratory infections122. Furthermore, COVID 19 infection has also been implicated in several biological processes relevant to MDD and associated physi cal diseases, such as immune activation, particularly in those with severe acute infection120,123. Neuroimaging studies in people who have recovered from the infection have also identified numerous small brain changes, including structural and functional altera tions within the hippocampus124. Continued research is required to elucidate the potential neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID 19 infection.
SHARED RISK FACTORS
Lifestyle and behavioral risk factors
To fully understand the comorbidity between MDD and physi cal diseases, it is crucial to consider the role of health behaviors. In the general population, there is broad acceptance that adverse health behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, or illicit drug use can increase the risk of physical diseases and as sociated mortality125,126. Additionally, there is strong evidence that low physical activity, poor diet, and poor sleeping patterns are key drivers of subsequent physical diseases. For instance, the World Health Organization’s 2020 Physical Ac tivity Guidelines presented moderate certainty evidence of a cur vilinear dose response relationship between physical activity and risk of all cause mortality and multiple life threatening physical diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and even cancers127. Similarly, striking data on the impact of eating pat terns was provided by the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study128, which identified “poor dietary habits” as one of the leading risk factors for mortality worldwide, with almost one fifth of all deaths attributable to it. While the relationship between sleep and disease is non linear, there is a strong indication from large scale studies that sleeping problems are a risk factor for common physical diseases129, with either too short or too long sleep durations associated with in creased mortality risk130. These lifestyle factors are also likely to be a central driver of the heightened rates of physical diseases (and associated mortality) observed in MDD, especially when considering the extensive evi dence that people with MDD are affected by the same lifestyle and behavioral health risks131,132. For instance, systematic reviews have found that people with MDD are significantly more likely to engage in excessive alcohol and tobacco use131,132, and have a higher total food intake and reduced diet quality133, higher levels of sedentary behavior134, and poorer sleep continuity and quality135, compared to non depressed people. Despite the observed trends, the causality of the relationships between health behaviors and MDD is unclear and likely bidi rectional. On the one hand, multiple independent meta analyses of prospective data have shown that physical inactivity, tobacco
smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, impaired sleep, and poor diet at baseline are all associated with a subsequently increased risk of developing MDD136,137. On the other hand, developing MDD can have a pronounced detrimental impact on an individual’s health behaviors, including sleep impairment, low motivation for physical activity, over/under eating, and a propensity to self medicate with tobacco, alcohol or substance use138,139. MDD is also associated with reduced adherence to treatment for chronic diseases, which may further exacerbate disease outcomes140. Furthermore, certain medications used to treat MDD may induce be havioral risks. For instance, the appetite increasing effects of med ications such as mirtazapine and quetiapine may partially account for the increased risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases among people treated with these medications141,142, while the sedative ef fects of agents such as mirtazapine and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g.,amitriptyline,clomipramine)138 couldinhibit individuals from engaging in regular physical activity.
Stressful life events
Life stressors can have negative consequences on both mental and physical health across the lifespan. Research on early life stress – often referred to as childhood adversity or adverse childhood ex periences – primarily focuses on experiences of maltreatment (e.g., abuse or neglect) and household dysfunction (e.g., domestic vio lence or parental mental illness)143,144. For instance, accumulating evidence from several meta analyses of both retrospective and pro spective studies suggests that adverse childhood experiences are related to a more than two fold increase in the risk of developing MDD in adulthood143,145. In parallel, a recent meta review of 16 meta analyses indicated moderate associations between adverse childhood experiences and respiratory diseases (d=0.44), gastrointestinal diseases (d=0.38), neurological diseases and pain (d=0.34), and cardiovascular dis eases (d=0.32), as well as weak associations with cancer (d=0.24), diseases of the musculoskeletal system (d=0.21), and endocrine and metabolic diseases (d=0.17) in adulthood144. Adverse childhood experiences are additionally associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing further severe stressful life events later in life (e.g., losing one’s job or divorce)146149 . Notably, severe stressful life events frequently precede the onset of a first episode of MDD150. Furthermore, a meta analysis of six RCTs151 suggests that, although severe stressful life events affect the prognosis of individ uals seeking treatment for MDD, these effects are largely shared with environmental factors (e.g., social support or employment sta tus) that may be a consequence of the experience of trauma. Severe stressful life events are also associated with an increased risk of physical diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases152. Adults from the general population who experienced a stressful life event had a 1.1 to 1.6 fold elevated risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke152. Stressful life events can also act as a disease trigger among individuals at risk for cardiovascular diseases, and as a factor aggravating the prognosis of these diseases152. A further consideration is that physical diseases and their related symptoms

(e.g., pain, fatigue), as well as treatment related factors (e.g., sur gery, medication side effects), can be a stressful life event accom panied by feelings of grief, stress, shame, and other negative psy chological states that can exacerbate or increase the risk of MDD. It is important to note that not all individuals who experience life stress develop MDD and/or a physical disease153,154. Indeed, a meta analysis of cross sectional studies showed that resilience (i.e., the ability to successfully adapt to difficult, challenging or disrup tive life events) significantly mediated the association between ad verse childhood experiences and symptoms of MDD155. Likewise, social connection and belongingness, adaptive lifestyle behav iors, positive parenting, and supportive relationships from carers, friends and within the community are all resilience promoting factors that may have a protective effect on an individual’s risk for MDD following adverse childhood experiences156,157.
Social risk factors
Reducing the burden of disease related to MDD and poor physi cal health requires the focus to move beyond individual risk and protective factors to consider the social determinants of health, i.e., “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age”158. In this context, risk and protective factors cluster and are interwoven at multiple levels. Some occur at different times, while others persist across the life course159. There is clear evidence that both MDD and physical diseases are more common in people from disadvantaged backgrounds160,161. Both absolute poverty (i.e., level of income necessary to maintain basic living standards) and relative poverty or deprivation (i.e., level of income necessary to maintain minimum living standards relative to those of a society or country) have independent, adverse impacts on mental and physical health. Indigenous people, those from cul tural or linguistic minorities, migrants or refugees, and people with a disability are more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvan tage than other individuals in the community162. Intergenerational poverty and trauma are also common and confer an additional risk to family members of parents who live in poverty. Other common social determinants that intersect with the afore mentioned variables include gender inequality and restrictive gen der norms, which, in many settings, privilege the male or masculine over the female or feminine163. Discrimination, marginalization and victimization linked to gender are associated with a greater risk of experiencing poor mental and physical health. This appears to be mediated through exposure to stress related experiences, but may be also driven by gender specific disparities in access to education, home ownership, and safety in the home and employment (women and girls), or an over representation in the criminal justice system and reduced access to health care (men and boys)164. Racial, ethnic or sexual minority status is associated with higher rates of health problems, through experiences of discrimination and systemic biases165. Structural racism, cultural racism166 and inter generational trauma can also impact on mental and physical health. As with gender norms, norms related to race become embedded in later childhood and adolescence, and the effects persist across the
life course167. The above social determinants exert their impacts on mental and physical health through multiple inter related mechanisms. Effects on health may be direct (e.g., through restricted access to quality nutrition) or mediated through individual (e.g., security provided by safe housing and/or neighborhoods), relational (e.g., exposure to parental stress in childhood; presence of positive peer relation ships in adolescence), psychological (e.g., effects on self efficacy), or institutional (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, access to health care) factors168. These factors interact in complex ways with other social determinants (e.g., gender inequality, exposure to hazardous work, child labor). For example, low social status because of pov erty may be associated with discrimination and other disadvan tages (e.g., exposure to violence, social isolation or loneliness), all of which are associated with poor mental and physical health169172 . Such processes also have a developmental and transgenera tional aspect161. The impacts of exposure to adversity may differ according to developmental periods, and health impacts may also vary by type of adversity. Children and adolescents raised in pov erty may be less likely to accumulate the “health capital” that con tributes to educational attainment, health literacy, a healthy parent child attachment style, positive peer relationships, the develop ment of social and emotional skills, and the ability to parent later in their own life173. As a consequence, early life poverty contributes to intergenerational cycles of poverty and transmission of mental and physical health risks173. In contrast, protective factors such as access to resources (e.g., education), consistent relationships (i.e., supportive and stable families), and social and policy factors (e.g., access to affordable health care, social welfare) may assist individu als to overcome the impacts of adversity174.
SHARED BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS
Several biological pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of both MDD and physical diseases (see Figure 4). Here, we first provide a conceptual overview of how these shared pathways con tribute to disease outcomes, and then discuss several prominently investigated biological mechanisms. Pathogenesis is unlikely to be driven by any singular pathway alone, but rather by the interaction of multiple pathways affecting both mental and physical health.
Neuroprogression and somatoprogression
The term “neuroprogression” refers to the process of psychi atric disease acceleration and its underlying operative factors, in cluding reduced neurogenesis and increased apoptosis as well as hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, immune and oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Its manifesta tions, such as impaired cognitive function and structural neuroim aging changes, and consequent deteriorating function and declin ing treatment response, tend to increase with stage175,176. The same pathways (e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress, mito chondrial dysfunction) that are involved in neuroprogression of MDD

have a parallel role in the genesis and progression of many physical comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome. The term “somatoprogression” refers to these pathways and the accumulation of a physical comorbidity that often occurs in parallel to neuroprogression. This construct overlaps with that of al lostatic load, which encompasses biological effects secondary to the aggregate burden of stress and wear and tear on the body177. The above two parallel processes provide a theoretical founda tion for the comorbidity across MDD and physical diseases. Under standing these processes also provides a mechanistic foundation for the construct of clinical staging178. Many of the individual ele ments of progression – such as inflammation179, oxidative stress180, and neurogenesis181 – are also individually targetable and poten tially plastic.
Genetics
Both MDD and several physical diseases have a substantial ge netic component. For example, family and twin studies suggest
that the genetic contribution to MDD accounts for approximately 37% of the variation in susceptibility182. Similar rates are estimat ed for physical diseases such as coronary artery disease (~43%)183 and stroke (~38%)184. Furthermore, several large meta analyses of genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci associated with MDD185 as well as with many physical diseases, such as obesity186, type 2 diabetes mellitus187, and heart disease188. There are several shared genetic factors between MDD and phys ical diseases. For example, in a large UK study, significant genetic correlations were identified between MDD and body mass index, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus189. The signif icant genetic overlap between MDD and cardiometabolic condi tions, in particular coronary artery disease and obesity, has been confirmed in other studies190. In contrast, a large study by the Brain storm Consortium reported little genetic overlap between common neurological diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, multi ple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease) and psychiatric diseases in cluding MDD191. A recent systematic review identified 24 pleiotropic genes that are shared between mood disorders and cardiometabolic condi

tions192. Shared genetic pathways were detected between type 2 di abetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, obesity and MDD, relating to axonal guidance (e.g., glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, insulin like growth factor 1), corticotropin releasing hormone, and 5ʹ aden
osine monophosphate activated protein kinase signaling192.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
Stress is a major precipitating factor for the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders, including MDD. HPA axis dysregulation has been implicated in the onset, symptom profile, severity, chro nicity, treatment response, and treatment resistance in MDD193196 . A large meta analysis reported that individuals with MDD tend to display elevated cortisol (d=0.33, 95% CI: 0.21 0.45) and adrenocor ticotropic hormone (ACTH) (d=0.27, 95% CI: 0.00 0.54) levels195. HPA axis dysregulation in MDD becomes more pervasive with age. For example, basal cortisol is elevated during all phases of the diurnal cycle in older adults with MDD (g=0.88, 95% CI: 0.60 1.15) 197. This is noteworthy, as late life MDD is associated with immune dysregulation and high rates of comorbid physical diseases197 and consequent polypharmacy. Mechanistically, the signal transduction of glucocorticoids is in volved in an array of behavioral, cardiovascular, cognitive, immu nological, metabolic and reproductive processes198,199. According to longitudinal data from a large cohort study200, increased levels of hair cortisol were predictive of MDD somatic symptoms. Further more, the results of a meta analysis195 support the notion that HPA axis hyperactivity is a link between MDD and comorbid physical dis eases, such as diabetes mellitus, dementia, coronary heart disease, and osteoporosis. This link seems to be particularly pronounced in people who present with melancholic or psychotic features195. It is, however, worth noting that there are several other pathways in volved in the stress response that may be relevant to the comorbid ity between MDD and some physical diseases, including the re nin angiotensin system201. Unfortunately, despite the apparently common co occurrence of HPA axis dysregulation, MDD and comorbid physical diseases, few clinical studies have specifically investigated their interplay. Exclu sion criteria have been often applied to people with both MDD and a comorbid physical disease in clinical trials. There is some indication that sex specific differences in HPA ax is dysregulation exist in humans. However, the relevant evidence is somewhat contradictory (possibly due to variability in menstrual cy cle stage, health, age, or stress modality)202. This area is still largely underresearched.
Inflammation
It is generally appreciated that MDD is associated with inflam mation203, at least in a proportion of individuals (~30 50%)204. In large meta analyses, MDD has been related to the up or down regulation of acute phase reactants205, cytokines206 and chemo kines207. Low grade inflammation – as indexed by a concentration
of C reactive protein (CRP) higher than 3 mg/L – is more likely in individuals with depression than in matched controls, occurring in around a quarter of the former according to a large meta analysis (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22 1.75)205. Chronic low grade inflammation is also a feature of a variety of physical diseases (e.g., cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases; cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis) as well as of other serious mental disorders208211 . In both atherosclerotic conditions and de pressive episodes, a pro inflammatory state can be induced by hy percortisolemia, reduced paraoxonase 1 levels, as well as reduced HDL and elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lead ing to endothelial injury and the downstream release of interleu kin 6 (IL 6), CRP, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and soluble
endothelial adhesion molecules211. Activated immune cells release IL1β , stimulating the production of interferon gamma and TNFα, which are commonly elevated in MDD, cardiovascular diseases, met abolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune condi tions such as rheumatoid arthritis212. Data driven GWAS analysis supports the association between MDD and immune disorder liability. A recent study (N=500,199) found that MDD was positively correlated with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, hyperthyroidism and asthma (Z scores: 0.09 0.19, q<0.05)213. The most robust association was observed for asthma (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.13 1.37)213. IL 4 is a major cytokine involved in asthma, and is associated with a T helper (Th) 2 cell response212. In MDD, the induction of M1 macrophage cells may lead to IL 4 pro duction via the compensatory immune regulatory system (CIRS) Th2 response 212. Another point of possible overlap is in elevation of highly pro inflammatory Th 17 cells, which are implicated in au toimmune disorders212. Emerging evidence supports a role for Th 17 cells in the genesis and progression of MDD214,215. This suggests that there may be a subgroup of MDD people with a “lymphoid im munophenotype” (adaptive immune response), contrasting with the innate immune response myeloid immunophenotype204.
Mitochondrial function and energy metabolism
Mitochondrial function is widely recognized as a factor in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including MDD216, and a variety of physical conditions, such as metabolic diseases217, cardiovascular diseases218, and neurodegenerative disorders219. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and are involved in calcium homeostasis, as well as playing key roles in the redox state of the cell and apoptosis. For example, mitochondrial dynamics substantially affect cardiomyo cyte health, with multiple rodent studies showing that alterations to processes such as fusion and fission can lead to cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart failure220. ATP produc tion is also impaired in people with MDD compared with healthy controls221,222. Preclinical models of MDD suppress mitochondrial function223. In humans, there is evidence of reduced mitochondrial respiration221 and neuroimaging evidence of decreased energy gen eration224 in MDD. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an excess of reactive oxy

gen species, which are predominantly produced by mitochondria during the process of respiration, and especially when respiration is inefficient. While reactive oxygen species are required by cells and play a role in processes such as cell signaling, a sustained excess of these species can cause damage to DNA and various cellular struc tures225. There is a wealth of evidence that oxidative stress is associ ated with both MDD227 and several physical conditions, such as insulin resistance217 and cardiovascular diseases218,227. Mitophagyistheselectivedegradationofdysfunctional/damaged mitochondria, and is a crucial process for optimal cellular function and in the adaptation to cellular stress. Adequate mitophagy is not only required for optimal ATP production, but also to reduce oxi dative stress, and impairments to mitophagy have been associated with both MDD and physical diseases such as cardiovascular dis eases228,229 and neurodegenerative disorders230. For example, insuf ficient mitophagy has been shown to have a role in the development of atherosclerosis, which is partly mitigated by inflammatory pro cesses, and could contribute to cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction231.
Gut microbiome
The gut microbiome, increasingly implicated in MDD and other psychiatric disorders232, as well as in several physical diseases, may potentially underpin their interactions. The microbiome affects the gut brain axis through several of the aforementioned shared mech anisms, i.e. regulating physiological homeostasis via the autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis, and signaling within and be tween the enteric and central nervous systems via neuromodula tory metabolites and immunomodulatory responses233. There is overlap in the relevant mechanistic pathways across MDD and physical diseases. Prime amongst these is the physical maintenance of the tight junction integrity of the intestinal epithe lium, which contains immune signaling pathways and is mediated by the microbiome and its metabolites234. Disruptions to the gut ep ithelial cell wall and transfer of microorganism associated molecu lar patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), cause an immune cascade through the activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) and in flammatory responses, with flow on effects to blood brain barrier function and neuroinflammation235,236. In addition to a compelling body of pre clinical evidence237, plasma biomarkers of increased gut permeability, including LPS and zonulin, have been found in greater abundance in people with depressive disorders compared to healthy controls238. Evidence of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract to systemic circulation has been observed within several or gans and tissues and is considered contributory to a range of physi cal diseases. For example, atherosclerotic plaques have microbial communities resembling the gut and oral microbiomes. The result ing immune activation may contribute to the pathophysiology of plaques in the context of cardiovascular disease239. In the metabol ic syndrome, systemic LPS activates a TLR4 mediated inflamma tory response and alters insulin signaling within white adipose tis sue240. Increased osteoclastic activity and reduced bone mineral
density have been observed following increased intestinal permea bility in the context of osteoporosis241. Evidence of serum and plas ma IgG against periodontal bacteria in human and animal studies of Alzheimer’s disease has also supported the systemic and neuro logical relevance of the oral microbiome242. Microbial metabolites – most notably, short chain fatty acids, tri methylamine N oxide and bile acids – have cell specific effects on the central nervous system as well as on peripheral organs involved in MDD comorbidities233. The strength of evidence for microbial causation varies across conditions, being relatively stronger in the metabolic syndrome. For example, germ free mice are resistant to the obesogenic effects of high fat diets243, whilst wild type and germ free mice experience metabolic alterations from microbiota mod ulating antibiotic and fecal microbiota transplant interventions244 247. However, this link is less established in osteoporosis and can cers outside of colorectal cancer241,248. Larger longitudinal cohort and intervention studies are required to translate pre clinical ob servations across all diseases.
Brain structure and function
Severe emotional distress can directly or indirectly (e.g., through functional reorganization of associated neural networks) affect neural substrates that are key in modulating depressive symp toms249, including hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, insula, striatum, and medial and orbitofrontal as well as anterior cingulate cortices250252 . Physical diseases (e.g., stroke, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease), as well as lesions or neurodegeneration induced by such diseases, can simi larly affect these neural substrates via disease specific pathology or indirectly via elevated emotional distress (e.g., at time of diagnosis and adjustment). Common neural circuitries can also emerge from shared under lying biological mechanisms. These constitute either common un derlying mechanisms influencing the liability to both MDD and physical diseases, or mediating mechanisms in causal relationships between MDD and physical diseases. Autonomic, immunoinflam matory and neuroendocrine dysregulations influence the brain’s homeostatic, cognitive, reward and emotional circuitries253. The in sula, the hypothalamus (particularly the paraventricular nucleus) and the anterior cingulate cortex play a critical role in monitoring the body’s homeostatic state. Deficiencies in immunological, glu cocorticoid and metabolic (e.g., leptin, insulin) signaling affect the activity of these interoceptive regions and their connectivity with core emotional, cognitive and motivational brain regions254. Alterations in interoceptive regions are associated with “sickness behavior”, characterized by lack of energy, weakness, hyperal gesia, loss of appetite and insomnia, commonly associated with both MDD and physical diseases such as cancer255,256, as well as symptoms of increased appetite, energy balance disturbances and hypersomnia, which are shared between atypical MDD and metabolic diseases including obesity, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus15,257. Deficiencies in endocrine and immunologi cal signaling via interoceptive pathways can also lead to interrup

tions in dopamine signaling in the brain’s reward and motivation circuitries258, most notably in the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum259,260. An extensive literature implicates shared alterations in the reward circuitry in MDD, neurodegenerative disorders, and obesity261263 . The interoceptive network receives afferent projections from the vagus nerve via the nucleus tractus solitarius and the thalamus264, thereby receiving information from respiratory, cardiac and gastric sources. A frontal vagal brain network – including the medulla of brainstem, hypothalamus, amygdala, insula, as well as dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex – has been proposed to link cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and MDD, because of its influence on the cardiovascular system, mood, appetite and sleep265. Finally, hippocampal atrophy is shared across MDD and many physical diseases. Impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis, neu roplasticity and dendritic remodeling is critically linked to several physical conditions266268 . On the other hand, lower hippocampal volume is one of the most consistently reported structural brain ab normalities in MDD250,269. The hippocampus is part of the brain’s default mode network. Grey matter and functional connectivity of
this network are commonly affected in MDD and neurological dis
eases270,271.
CLINICAL MANAGEMENT
Diagnosis of comorbid MDD and physical diseases
Diagnosing comorbid MDD in people with physical diseases can be challenging, as several depressive symptoms overlap with symp toms of these diseases (e.g., fatigue, aching, sleep disturbances, appetite and weight changes), thus showing poorer sensitivity and specificity in this context. Furthermore, grief and distress due to physical diseases are frequent, particularly in severe disease states (e.g., terminal cancer), and can result in clinical difficulties to dis tinguish between adjustment reactions or “appropriate sadness” and MDD272. For example, a study reported that only half of indi viduals with MDD and diabetes mellitus were recognized as having depression during standard care and, out of those correctly identi fied, few received adequate treatment273. Similar complexities are present for the appropriate diagnosis of physical diseases in people with MDD. This has been termed “di agnostic overshadowing”, describing the tendency for clinicians to misattribute physical symptoms (e.g., pain) to a person’s mental dis order rather to a potential comorbid physical disease274.
Prevention of comorbid MDD
Interventions aimed to prevent MDD have been explored in peo ple with at risk physical diseases. A Cochrane review275 found very low certainty evidence from ten RCTs supporting the use of anti depressant medications in the prevention of MDD. Similar results have been reported by systematic reviews of trials exploring anti
depressant medications as a means for preventing MDD related to administration of interferon alpha. However, due to the limited evi dence base, tolerability and acceptability of preventive antidepres sant use has not been rigorously assessed. Further research is re quired to ensure that the benefits of prophylactic interventions outweigh potential medical (e.g., side effects) and financial consid erations. Preventive psychotherapy interventions have been similarly un derstudied. The previously cited Cochrane review275 identified only one trial (N=193), which examined problem solving therapy in age related macular degeneration, and found lower odds for devel oping MDD compared with treatment as usual (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.20 0.95). A recent meta analysis of RCTs of psychotherapy – mostly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – as a preventive inter vention for MDD found positive results, including for a sub sample of people with physical diseases (n=11; RR: 0.71)276. A systematic review of five RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy in preventing MDD in adults with cancer found that it was superior to usual care (standardized mean difference, SMD: –0.23). In a co hort of people with breast cancer, findings were similarly favorable (SMD: –0.32)277. However, a large RCT in people with cardiovascular disease and/ or diabetes showed that there was no significant effect of a CBT based preventive program. Four risk factors predicted MDD at fol low up: baseline anxiety and MDD symptoms, stressful life events, and the presence of three or more chronic diseases278. It may be that preventive programs will be more effective if targeted at high risk cohorts such as those with high subclinical depressive symp toms (indicated prevention) or other MDD risk factors (selective prevention). In summary, proactive treatment to prevent MDD in at risk indi viduals with physical diseases may be a viable approach, but large high quality RCTs are needed.
Treatment of comorbid MDD
Among individuals with MDD and a physical disease, systematic reviews of RCTs have shown that antidepressants, compared to pla cebo, show effect sizes similar to or even larger (i.e., SMDs higher than 0.50)279286 than those for MDD without physical comorbidity, where SMDs range between 0.17 and 0.49287. Such effect sizes have been reported for MDD comorbid with cardiovascular diseases (e.g., coronary artery disease281, ischemic heart disease282, myocardial infaction288), neurological diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis279, Par kinson’s disease289, stroke290,291), diabetes mellitus292, cancer286,293, rheumatoid arthritis280 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection294. Whether these larger effect sizes are due to differing biological processes, smaller placebo effects, or other reasons such as small study inflation, needs further study. Indeed, most meta analyses were based on a few small RCTs. In other diseases – such as epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, traumatic brain injury, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – few or no RCTs of antidepressant treatment for comorbid MDDhavebeenconducted295301 ,resultinginasparseevidencebase

for treatment recommendations. Many studies have demonstrated that psychotherapies302–in cluding CBT303305 , mindfulness based interventions306308 , com passionfocused therapies 309,310 and problem solving therapy311 – effectively treat MDD in people with diseases such as cancer307,308, diabetes mellitus312,313, cardiovascular diseases314318 , HIV infec tion319, psoriasis320, multiple sclerosis279,321,322, inflammatory bowel disease305, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease323325 , and kidney failure326328 . Regardless of intervention type, effect sizes are generally low to moderate309, and many individual studies are at risk of bias309, have low sample sizes, and use heterogenous research designs310. Find ings concerning cardiovascular diseases are more robust, particu larly in people with heart failure. An umbrella review concluded that there is sound evidence that psychotherapy can treat MDD in people with ischemic heart disease, based on the findings of four systematic reviews318. Similarly, in a scoping review of nine psy chotherapy trials, seven showed significant reductions in MDD symptoms, although two did not maintain benefit at longer term followup 314. Psychotherapy can also be delivered online or via telephone to people with physical diseases, with comparable outcomes to face toface delivery 303,304,322,329, particularly if clinician guided303. These modalities have also been shown to be acceptable to individu als330,331, which is particularly important for those who may have mobility or accessibility difficulties322.
Effect of MDD treatments on physical disease outcomes
In addition to improving depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication may have positive effects on physical disease outcomes. For example, a recent umbrella review found that SSRIs may im prove fasting glucose/HbA1c and pain332, and may reduce hospital ization rates in coronary artery disease281. Among individuals with diabetes mellitus, antidepressant treatment is reported by RCTs to improve glycemic control292, and is associated with lower mor tality333 and a lower risk for myocardial infarction334. Further more, antidepressants improve motor function and disability after stroke290, and motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease289. There is also tentative evidence that psychotherapies may im prove physical health related quality of life and fasting glucose/ HbA1C332, and have a positive impact on physical outcomes in people with ischemic heart disease318. However, results are limited by the low quality of trials, and recent advances in medical care may have outweighed previously demonstrated benefits of psy chotherapy318. A systematic review found that the effect of psy chotherapy on disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease was not clear305. A systematic review focusing on people with rheumatic condi tions reported that CBT led to reduction of pain severity in four of seven studies, and to significant reduction of fatigue in one of four studies329. Psychotherapy may also lead to increased engagement in lifestyle behaviors that positively influence physical health327,335. For example, CBT has been found to improve medication adher
ence in people undergoing dialysis327. However, it is not yet known
whether these changes translate into improved physical outcomes
327.
Effect of physical disease treatments on MDD outcomes
Medications such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, drugs acting on the renin angiotensin system, and cytokine inhibi tors may yield additional positive effects when added to an anti depressant179,336339 , reducing depressive symptoms among indi viduals with a physical disease338,339. As a prominent example, a re cent meta analysis found that anti inflammatory drugs improved depressive symptoms with a SMD of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.40 0.88) when used as add on to antidepressants in MDD, and of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 0.60) when used as monotherapy among people with a physi cal disease338. Furthermore, anti inflammatory add on to antide pressants in MDD improved response and remission rates338. Themostfrequentlystudiedanti inflammatorydrugsareNSAIDs, cytokine inhibitors and statins. Several of these drugs (e.g., statins) target physical diseases that are disproportionally common in peo ple with MDD (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus)340. The antidepressant effects of these drugs provide further support to the previously discussed shared biological mechanisms of MDD and physical diseases (e.g., inflammation, HPA axis activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction)341. On the other hand, many commonly used treatments for physi cal diseases can induce depressive symptoms as a side effect342. A well known example is interferon or IL 2 treatment, in which up to 80% of individuals develop depressive symptoms, often dominated by somatic/neurovegetative manifestations within the first weeks, and 25% develop a major depressive episode within 48 weeks343. The proposed mechanism is pro inflammatory and immune activat ing344, with administration of pro inflammatory cytokines repre senting one of the most robust human models of MDD345.
Adverse events and clinical considerations of management
Among individuals with physical diseases, it is important to bal ance the potential antidepressant effects of pharmacotherapy with possible side effects. The adverse event profile of any antidepres sant must be tailored to the symptomatic and risk profile of the co morbid physical disease and the specific individual. Potential ad verse events include weight gain and the related risk of developing or exacerbating diabetes mellitus (particularly relevant to tricyclic an tidepressants and mirtazapine)346; cardiac toxicity and QTc prolon gation (highest risk with tricyclic antidepressants and lowest with sertraline)347,348; impact on bone metabolism, increasing the risk for osteoporosis and fractures (especially with SSRIs)349; and bleeding, which is further increased when combining multiple classes of med ications (e.g., SSRIs and NSAIDs350). Furthermore, clinicians need to consider potential drug drug interactions, which are divided

into pharmacodynamic (more frequent with older antidepres sants) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., affecting hepatic metabolism, with antidepressants often being dependent on cytochrome P450 metabolism)351. Overall, the antidepressant treatment of MDD that is comorbid with a physical disease will benefit from interdisciplinary care (e.g., frequent discussions with the clinician responsible for the treatment ofthephysicaldisease),considerationofpatient relatedfactors(e.g., age, pain, polypharmacy, and previous antidepressant trials all affect choice of antidepressant drug), and ongoing management. Finally, psychotherapy trials have not systematically assessed ad verse events or contraindications352354 . Therefore, psychotherapy intervention trials in individuals with physical diseases have thus far reported very few adverse events, but clinical monitoring is in dicated310,324.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper reviews the substantial evidence base documenting that MDD is highly prevalent in populations with a range of common physical diseases, and vice versa. This high level of comorbidity translates into poorer economic and treatment outcomes. A range of mechanisms have been implicated in both MDD and comorbid physical diseases, suggesting shared pathophysiology. We have discussed prominent pathways, such as inflammation, the gut microbiome, mitochondrial function, brain structure and function, and the HPA axis. Additional pathways requiring further investigation are endothelial and autonomic dysfunction, leptin and insulin signaling, and biological aging2,15. Shared mechanisms provide opportunities for treatment that may benefit both MDD and comorbid physical diseases, but may also inform the investigation of potential off label interventions and drug repurposing strategies. For example, statin therapy, com monly prescribed for cardiovascular diseases, is being trialed for MDD355,356. Metformin (a medication typically prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus) and candesartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) are also being trialed for depression357. Similarly, there are a range of lifestyle, physiological, social and genetic risk factors that are shared by MDD and physical diseases358. Interventions that address these factors may improve both psychi atric and physical outcomes. An example is the developing evidence base to support the use of lifestyle approaches to mental health care. Clinical guidelines359 increasingly suggest that lifestyle interven tions should be a major component of MDD management. Of the lifestyle domains reviewed in one of these guidelines360, the strong est recommendations when treating MDD were for exercise, relax ation, and work directed, sleep and mindfulness based interven tions. There was further evidence to support dietary and green space interventions, but fewer data from RCTs to support interven tions targeting smoking, loneliness or social support. Further to the need for additional intervention and prevention strategies is the need for new models addressing challenges to ac cessible care and integrating psychiatric and physical consider ations361. Having MDD, as well as subthreshold depressive symp
toms, that are comorbid with a physical health condition amplifies barriers to accessing and engaging in potentially helpful treatments and self management strategies16. Treatment needs are often mul tiplied, diverse and chronic, placing strain on health services and families, especially in low and middle income countries, cultural and linguistic minorities, and First Nations people, and those in ru ral areas with scarce resources362. Innovative strategies to overcome these barriers, incorporating integrated care for physical health con
ditions (particularly cardiometabolic diseases) in MDD, are required
363.
One example is the collaborative care model, usually involving a physician and at least one other health professional (and sometimes peer or carer supports) who communicate with each other and the individual with MDD in a structured and planned way, to optimize treatment and care16,61. Contact and follow up appointments are organized by a central coordinator (e.g., a case manager) who pro motes self management strategies (e.g., symptom and treatment monitoring and management, goal setting, problem solving, healthy lifestyle habits, and stress management)364. There can also be em phasis on enhancing patient centered decision making, and con sideration of patients’ broader recovery goals16,365. Including lived experience input may also strengthen and support the broader aims of person centered management. Collaborative care interventions have shown positive effects for people with depressive symptoms and coronary heart disease366, breast cancer367, and diabetes mellitus292,364. Such interventions appear to be equally effective in delivering MDD care for people with and without physical diseases368. Their effect on physical health, however, varies depending on the specific condition292,369. Imple menting collaborative care interventions also requires careful con sideration of leadership and delivery resources, costs for ongoing care, and cultural context370. A further potential way to extend the reach and scope of effective treatment and care is provided by digital technologies. eHealth and mHealth interventions range from multicomponent intensive psy chosocial programs to briefer specific self management interven tions (e.g., targeting exercise)16,371373 . They can be adapted to suit context and resource capabilities, although the majority of RCTs are being conducted in high income countries372. A meta analysis of RCTs of digital interventions reported a sig nificant moderate effect on depressive outcomes (g=–0.37, 95% CI: –0.60 to –0.14)371. Key predictors of significant effects were a two way “clinician patient communication loop”, coupled with progress monitoring and adjustment of treatment as well as self manage ment strategies over time362,371. Successful interventions ranged from those delivered via phone to more complex ones delivered via web platforms, highlighting the adaptability of digital approach es371. At this stage, however, the number of trials on each comorbid physical disease varies, and results are inconsistent371,372. More at tention also needs to be paid to the scalability and validation of dig ital interventions and how they can be better integrated into health services362,372. In summary, there is now a substantial body of evidence doc umenting a shared biological and environmental pathogenesis between MDD and several physical diseases. Further efforts are

required to develop prevention and intervention strategies that target these shared pathways. These include investigation of thera peutics that target overlapping biological mechanisms (e.g., statins, metformin, interventions on gut microbiome) and the integration of strategies that address risk factors such as lifestyle behavior (e.g., exercise, diet). Furthermore, research and implementation efforts are now required to accelerate the development and translation of transdiagnostic, interdisciplinary models of care that consider both psychiatric and somatic presentations.
