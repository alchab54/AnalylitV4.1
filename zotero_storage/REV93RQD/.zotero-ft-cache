Abstract:
Empathic communications between a patient and therapist are an essential component of
psychotherapy. However, objective neural markers of the quality of the psychotherapeutic relationship
have been elusive. Here we conceptualize how a neuroscience-informed approach involving real-time
neurofeedback, facilitated via existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) technologies, has the potential to provide objective information for
facilitating therapeutic rapport. We propose several neurofeedback-assisted psychotherapy (NF-AP)
approaches that could offer the potential for optimizing the experience of the individual patient and
therapist across the spectrum of psychotherapeutic treatment. Finally, we consider how the possible
strengths of these approaches are balanced by the current limitations and discuss the prospects of NF
AP.

1. Introduction
The quality of the therapeutic relationship is one of the most established predictors of a
patient’s ability to improve with psychotherapy (Arnow et al., 2003; Blatt et al., 1996; Martin et al.,
2000; Marziali, 1984; Marziali and Alexander, 1991; McCabe and Priebe, 2004; Woollcott, 1985). With
the advent and pervasive application of neuroscience methodologies such as functional neuroimaging, a
substantial literature has emerged detailing the effects of various forms of psychotherapy on brain
activity across numerous disorders (Barsaglini et al., 2014; Cozolino, 2017). Despite these advances,
substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, particularly with respect to the manner in which functional
neuroimaging tools can directly impact brain function—or potentially augment it. Here we conceptualize
how a neuroscience-informed approach involving real-time neurofeedback, facilitated via existing
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) technologies, might
provide objective information for quantifying therapeutic rapport. Introducing the concept of
neurofeedback-assisted psychotherapy (NF-AP), we describe approaches that could offer the potential
for optimizing the experience of the individual patient and therapist across the spectrum of
psychotherapeutic treatment. Given the nascent status of this emerging topic, we first (1) review
definitions related to the therapy-client relationship and the ways in which neurofeedback could
hypothetically be used to enhance this relationship and therapy outcomes, and then we (2) review
findings from a scoping review of the available scientific studies in the area.
1.1 Incorporating neurofeedback into therapist-patient communication
Neurofeedback technologies provide an opportunity to observe brain activity in real time
during affective and empathic components of the therapeutic process. It involves interventions that
provide individuals with information about their brain activity with the goal of teaching them to
modulate their brain activity by themselves. There are several methods for delivering neurofeedback,


4
including via a functional neuroimaging approach called real-time functional magnetic resonance
(rtfMRI), via an electrophysiological approach such as electroencephalography (EEG), or via a
combination of the two (Zotev et al., 2014). Previous studies using these technologies have shown that
neurofeedback interventions can help humans to increase their control of emotional self-regulation
(Zotev et al., 2014) or cognitive performance (Zoefel et al., 2011).
The delivery of neurofeedback interventions in non-psychotherapeutic formats has shown
potential clinical efficacy in improving mental health symptoms. An early experiment from our group
utilized rtfMRI to map activity of in the left amygdala, a region of the brain known to be involved in
emotional processing, when recalling positive memories in depressed individuals (Figure 1). Participants
who were continuously shown their left amygdala activity and encouraged to increase hemodynamic
activity in this region while recalling positive memories were able to significantly increase the activation
of this area. Additionally, follow up a week later showed that, compared to a control group that
underwent the same experiment but focused instead on a region of the parietal lobe not associated
with emotional processing, the amygdala group achieved significant relief of depressive symptoms and
better recall of positive memories (Young et al., 2017). In a recent proof-of-concept study in healthy
individuals, we showed that changes in the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in repetitive
negative thinking (i.e., rumination), specifically the precuneus and right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ)
could be successfully targeted using rtfMRI (Tsuchiyagaito et al., 2021a). These demonstrations raise the
possibility that targeting the functional activity of individual neural structures or connectivity of multiple
structures might be useful when applied as an augmenting tool in the context of ongoing
psychotherapy.

measurement tool (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) or
electroencephalography (EEG)) records neural signals from a patient in a region of interest (ROI). 2) The
patient is presented an objective rendering of their neural activity that allows them to compare and
attempt to match their neural activity with an instructed target. 3) The patient adjusts their self
regulation strategy to achieve the desired signal. The gray arrows represent the feedback cycle, showing
how real-time data informs the patient’s self-regulation strategies, which in turn affects the recorded
brain activity, thus closing the loop. This process is iterative, with the patient attempting to self-regulate
the brain activity more closely match the target level with each cycle.


6
The development of neurofeedback-assisted psychotherapy (NF-AP) provides a new opportunity
to investigate the intersection of neuroscience and clinical practice. For example, NF-AP could stand not
only as a tool for examining the basic neurophysiological underpinnings of therapist-client interactions
but also as a means to actively enhance the therapeutic engagement. Although neurofeedback has been
shown to be particularly effective when augmenting established psychotherapies such as Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (Compere et al., 2023; MacDuffie et al., 2018) and Dialectical Behavior
Therapy (DBT) (Paret et al., 2016; Zaehringer et al., 2019), these applications have typically involved
pairing the application of standard neurofeedback tasks in patients undergoing standard psychotherapy.
With NF-AP, we emphasize a more blended approach whereby the neurofeedback tools are integrated
into the psychotherapy practice to better facilitate the awareness and self-regulation of neural patterns
associated with specific behaviors or thought processes. Importantly, this review adopts a broad
definition of psychotherapy. Generally speaking, we define psychotherapy (also commonly referred to
as counseling or talk therapy) as a form of non-pharmacologic mental health treatment that involves
conversational interactions between a therapist and a client focused on a set of symptoms or problems,
aiming to help individuals identify and change unhealthy or maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and
behaviors. Therapeutic alliance involves a trusting, cooperative relationship between therapist and client,
which involves socio-emotional aspects of the personal relationship (e.g., mutual understanding and liking)
and the collaborative, task-related aspects of the relationship (e.g., goal consensus)(Moss and Glowiak, 2013;
Tschacher et al., 2015). The socio-emotional and task-related aspects of alliance can each be facilitated by the
therapist, with approaches such as authenticity/genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and
nonjudgment/acceptance supporting the former and communication of expert knowledge, therapeutic
rationale, or confidence supporting the latter (Moss and Glowiak, 2013). Both of these aspects of alliance can
be supported through what the therapist explicitly communicates as well as through behaviors that are often


7
referred to as “microcounseling skills”, involving active listening skills, eye contact, vocal tone, and attentive
body language..
Taking the application of NF-AP a step forward, ‘hyperscanning’ is a relatively recent functional
neuroimaging technique that simultaneously acquires signals from the brain of more than one
participant at the same time (Koike et al., 2015; Misaki et al., 2021). This methodology can be useful for
probing the temporal coherence between the brain activity of two interacting individuals, for example,
that of a parent and child (Hari and Kujala, 2009). Hyperscanning has been recently utilized to study
empathy in several different experiments. For example, a recent study identified significant brain
synchronization between two individuals engaged in an active listening exercise (Wang et al., 2022).
Similar findings have emerged in hyperscanning studies of comforting touch (Long et al., 2021; Shamay
Tsoory and Eisenberger, 2021) and sharing of painful memories (Peng et al., 2021). Finally, interbrain
synchrony has been shown to increase when dyads cooperate, leading to better performance of tasks
(Djalovski et al., 2021).
In summary, we argue that NF-AP may have potential for improving our understanding the
neural basis of dyadic interactions during psychotherapy, and for identifying how neural activity during
such interactions exerts positive impacts on mental health. We subsequently explore how these
approaches might be applied to dynamic social interactions in psychotherapy to investigate the
enhancement of empathic communication between therapist and patient.
1.1 The critical role of empathic interpersonal communication in the psychotherapeutic process
Human communication involves a complex process of reciprocating interactions. A
conversational interaction between two human beings requires each to pay attention to the other in a
nuanced manner that involves more than simply language, or even speech. Nonverbal communication,
such as facial gestures and body posture, conveys aspects of a person’s emotional experience of which


8
the individual may not even be aware (Meltzoff and Decety, 2003). At the neurophysiological level,
there may be a process in which the speaker and the listener influence each other’s neural processes in
order to engage in a regulated, turn-taking interaction. Elements of this process, including verbal and
non-verbal cues, joint attention by two participants on an external object, and gaze following, have been
hypothesized to underlie theory of mind (Baron-Cohen, 1995), which can be defined as the individual’s
capacity to ascribe mental states to others. This allows them to recognize and respect how others’
experiences differ from their own. Empathy comprises theory of mind but can be considered more
broadly as the capacity to share the feelings of others (Singer and Klimecki, 2014). Empathy allows
people to have the sense of a common emotional experience (e.g., vicariously feeling pain when seeing
another suffer) and is a powerful way of connecting with others in social contexts (Decety, 2011). All of
these functions are critical for maintaining effective communication in primary caregiving interactions.
For example, delays in temporal coherence can lead to a breakdown in communication between a
mother and child, with negative consequences (Wilson and Wilson, 2005).
Human communication has evolved to such a point that it can be employed to therapeutically
address psychopathology by means of psychotherapy (Scheflen, 1963). Psychotherapy can be delivered
to individuals or group formats, though the most common form of occurs via interactions between an
individual patient and therapist. A broad goal shared by most psychotherapies is to help the patient gain
insight into their circumstances, to learn about themselves and about their environment, in order to
improve their biopsychosocial health outcomes. The interaction between a patient and therapist, as
with any empathic social interaction, depends on both participants attending to each other and
continuously monitoring for turn-taking cues during the session (Campbell et al., 2013). These
mechanical components of interaction can support the development of an empathic bond between the
patient and therapist. However, fostering a successful patient-therapist dyad requires not only empathy
on the part of therapist, but also their ability to supportively engage the patient to evaluate and


9
sometimes challenge their own internal experiences. Empathy attunes the therapist to the patient’s
state of being and increases dyadic rapport while allowing the therapist to gently—or directly
challenge the patient’s inaccurate or maladaptive perceptions. This combination is often considered
essential to the achievement of beneficial change (Deits-Lebehn et al., 2020) but it requires a deft touch
on the part of the therapist as well as a high degree of rapport, as facing or challenging inner
experiences can elicit negative affective experiences or provoke other disorder-specific symptoms.
Therapeutic alliance in the context of psychotherapy can be thought of as a dynamic process of
achieving a therapeutic bond. It is achieved by an interactional process in which the patient responds to
a therapist’s interventions (often in the form of questioning), followed by the therapist responding to
the patient’s subsequent states. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that patient and therapist are
highly reactive to each other, and that patient-therapist alliance is a significant predictor of positive
therapeutic outcomes (Horvath et al., 2011). For example, one study found that patients’ responses to
empathetic and confrontational approaches by their therapist could be reliably assessed through
autonomic arousal and facial muscle activation (Voutilainen et al., 2018). An implication of this finding is
that the explicit visualization of psychophysiological cues might be utilized as a form of feedback to be
employed by the therapist and/or patient to increase positive outcomes during sessions (Deits-Lebehn
et al., 2020). However, autonomic arousal and facial cues represent peripheral expressions of a central
nervous system process and thus may be too indirect or insufficiently specific to rely on as objective
indicators of emotional status (Quigley and Barrett, 2014). Neural examinations of the primary
processes that underlie the cognitive states necessary for empathic communication may prove more
fruitful.
1.2 The Neurobiology of Empathy


10
While numerous central nervous system dependent processes contribute to the experience of
empathy, studies suggest that empathy primarily comprises two distinct components: 1) an affective
state that comprises shared emotional experiences (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009) and 2) a mentalizing (or
theory of mind) state concerned with understanding mental status of others (Masten et al., 2011).
Regarding the affective component of empathy, the neural networks responsible for the direct
experience of affect seem to overlap considerably with the regions involved in generating empathic
responses, and these networks are largely associated with the limbic system. For example, an empathic
response to another’s physical pain is reflected in anterior insular cortex and anterior midcingulate
cortex activity that are stimulated when experiencing physical pain first-hand (Engen and Singer, 2013).
The mentalizing component of empathy involves higher order polymodal regions of the brain
located within the prefrontal cortex. In one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment,
participants witnessing an episode of social exclusion showed increased activity in the medial prefrontal
cortex in addition to the precuneus (Masten et al., 2011). Additionally, individuals scoring more highly
on empathic measures activated the anterior insular cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, brain
areas that have been implicated in both mentalizing and social pain-related processing. These findings
suggest that complex empathic states, such as those relating to another person being ostracized, may
require neurocircuitries dedicated to mentalizing and affective processing.
Empathy also appears to be context specific. An experiment using fMRI to assess neural activity
during observations of social exclusion found that, when observing a friend suffer, participants showed
increased activity in affective pain regions of the brain (i.e., dorsal ACC and posterior/mid insular cortex)
more so than when they watched strangers receive the same treatment (Meyer et al., 2013).
Conversely, the mentalizing regions (i.e., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporal pole)
showed increased activity when observing strangers. This suggests the possibility that empathy towards


11
friends provokes a more visceral empathic response, while empathy toward strangers is of a more
distant and abstract variety.
1.4 Hyperscanning in psychotherapy
Building on individual neurofeedback, we expand into the realm of hyperscanning, which opens
the door to observing and influencing the complex interplay of neural activities between patient and
therapist. While distinct from a closed-loop neurofeedback system, hyperscanning can explore the
neural synchronization during empathetic exchanges and cooperative tasks, suggesting a potential
neural basis reflecting the human connection. In a therapeutic setting involving hyperscanning, there are
potential opportunities for both the patient and therapist to detect dyadic influences on neural
activation (Figure 2). Importantly, hyperscanning in a therapeutic context is not necessarily about
modulating brain activity in a closed-loop process. Instead, it involves accessing and utilizing neural
signatures (of either the patient, therapist, or both) as part of the therapeutic process. This can
potentially improve symptoms either by enhancing understanding and empathy within the therapeutic
relationship, or by engaging in direct, closed-loop neurofeedback.
1.5 Aims of this scoping review
The integration of empathic interpersonal communication, the neurobiology of empathy, and
new technologies such as neurofeedback and hyperscanning leads to a novel paradigm in
psychotherapy. NF-AP, supported by advancements in rtfMRI and EEG, have the potential to equip
therapists with valuable insights into the neurodynamics of therapist-patient interactions, potentially
enhancing the working alliance. This novel approach requires a detailed exploration of its potential
applications, methodological considerations, and implications for psychotherapy. Our aim is to conduct
a scoping review to provide deeper understanding of how NF-AP could be integrated into
psychotherapeutic practice.

Panels A) and B) represent a departure from standard neurofeedback delivery in which the user accesses their own neural activity and attempts to manipulate it (e.g., the closed neurofeedback loop depicted in Figure 1), because in each case, the user is only accessing the neural activity of their counterpart, while panel C) combines the standard neurofeedback delivery (i.e., self-monitoring and regulation) and its divergent use, where the user can see their counterpart’s neural activity to gain dyadic neural insight, and to potentially facilitate mutual understanding and interaction.
2. Methods


13
2.1 Study design
A scoping review was selected over a systematic review in order to synthesize and describe a
wide range of studies using different research methodologies without making analytic comparisons. This
approach allows for a comprehensive summary of the published literature and can provide guidance for
future research directions (Munn et al., 2018).
2.2 Identification of objectives and research questions for scoping review
The main objective of this review is to comprehensively understand how NF-AP for dyadic
interactions can be effectively utilized to enhance psychotherapeutic practices. Our goals include
describing the current status of NF-AP and hyperscanning, identifying its potential advantages and
challenges, and exploring its impact on communication and rapport in therapist-patient interactions.
Additionally, we aim to identify the roles of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as real-time fMRI,
EEG, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and hyperscanning, in
optimizing NF-AP, exploring both the technological aspects and the effects of the closed-loop approach
inherent in neurofeedback on therapeutic communication. This review also aims to provide
recommendations for integrating neurofeedback into psychotherapy and identifying areas for future
research. To achieve these objectives, we propose the following research questions:
(1) How have neurofeedback and hyperscanning been utilized to investigate empathy,
communications, and interactions in a psychotherapeutic context?
(2) How can neurofeedback and hyperscanning be integrated with psychotherapy and applied to
improve psychotherapeutic outcomes, potentially influenced by improved therapist-client
relationships?
The first question aims to uncover the ways in which neurofeedback and hyperscanning have
been applied in research settings to analyze and understand the dynamics of empathy, interpersonal
communication, and synchronization between individuals. The second question aims to explore


14
potential practical applications of neurofeedback and hyperscanning in enhancing therapy processes.
These questions and objectives are designed to guide a thorough and systematic scoping review,
providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of NF-AP with a particular focus on therapist
patient communications.

3.2 Use of neuroimaging technique to investigate empathy, communication, and interaction
Out of eight studies identified, various neuroimaging approaches were used: three implemented
fMRI-neurofeedback, two utilized fMRI-based hyperscanning, one engaged EEG-based hyperscanning,
and two employed fNIRS-based hyperscanning. The fMRI-neurofeedback studies aimed to modulate
brain responses associated with empathy and tenderness for potential therapeutic benefits in
individuals with limited emotional capacities (Kanel et al., 2019; Moll et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016).
Conversely, hyperscanning studies, which were observational rather than interventional, focused on the
synchronization of brain activity between pairs during social interaction (Ellingsen et al., 2022; Ellingsen
et al., 2020; Matiz et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Four studies explored the
therapist-patient dynamic, investigating the complexities of this therapeutic relationship (Ellingsen et al.,
2022; Ellingsen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020).
One study found that brain-to-brain concordance between the mid/posterior insular cortex of
the patient and the anterior insular cortex of the therapist were positively associated with subjective
assessments of therapeutic alliance (Ellingsen et al., 2022). Another study showed that among therapist
and chronic pain patient dyads, brain-to-brain concordance in networks involved in mentalizing and
social mirroring resulted in increased patient analgesia (Ellingsen et al., 2020). Further, a study
employing fNIRS-based hyperscanning revealed that psychological counseling sessions, as opposed to
chatting, led to stronger working alliances and increased interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) in the
rTPJ, a region integral to theory-of-mind processes (Zhang et al., 2018). Interestingly, experienced
counselors demonstrated a time-lagged IBS that aligned with the therapeutic goals, suggesting their
ability to attune their brain activity with clients in a goal-supportive manner (Zhang et al., 2020). These
studies raise the possibility that optimizing neural networks involved in empathy may have the potential
to lead to better therapeutic outcomes, while the mere presence of a therapist might influence these
outcomes, as evidenced in (Matiz et al., 2021). They observed that mindfulness meditation elicits

distinct brain activations when practiced alone versus with a partner, with significant differences in
gamma frequency EEG signals from putative limbic regions identified via source localization. Despite the
intriguing possibilities afforded by this approach, broader investigations have been thus far hindered by
the limited availability of this technology and the available expertise necessary to analyze such complex
datasets.
3.2 Use of neuroimaging technique to enhance empathy, communication, and interaction
Neuroimaging, particularly fMRI-neurofeedback, has been utilized in modulating brain regions
associated with empathy and affiliative emotions, as demonstrated in several studies (Kanel et al., 2019;
Moll et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016). These investigations have not only highlighted the potential of fMRI
neurofeedback in enhancing emotional processing in healthy subjects but also its applicability to those
with clinical needs. Two of those studies focused on the role of anterior insula and provided evidence
that fMRI-neurofeedback could amplify the anterior insula’s activity, promoting an empathetic response
to human voice (right anterior insula) (Kanel et al., 2019) or to pain (left anterior insula)(Yao et al.,
2016). Further, another study reported that individuals could volitionally control multiple brain regions
associated with tenderness and affection, thereby fostering prosocial behaviors (Moll et al., 2014).
3.3 Identifying gaps in NF-AP for dyadic interactions
These studies underscore the therapeutic potential of neurofeedback and hyperscanning in
enhancing empathy, emotional processing, and interpersonal dynamics. However, this scoping review
also makes clear how this field is still in its infancy, with numerous gaps in understanding and
implementation. The field has not yet fully explored how NF-AP, when adapted for therapist-patient
dyads, might enhance empathic interaction. This gap suggests the need for focused exploration into how
NF-AP designed for dyadic settings could significantly improve psychotherapeutic practices, deepening
our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying successful therapist-client working alliances
and their influence on treatment outcomes. Addressing this gap involves further studies to capture and


26
analyze empathic responses during psychotherapy. By analyzing these data, researchers can
demonstrate the presence of empathic responses in real-time during psychotherapy sessions.
Additionally, it is important to investigate how NF-AP can be specifically designed and utilized to
improve therapist-patient communication. This requires studies that not only observe empathic neural
responses but also examine the impact of NF-AP on enhancing the quality of communication and
therapeutic rapport in psychotherapy settings.
3.4 Improving the psychotherapeutic relationship through neurofeedback
Enhancing the working alliance through NF-AP involves leveraging neurofeedback to foster
greater empathy and communication between therapist and patient. By providing visual feedback on
neural activation patterns, NF-AP may help identify and reinforce moments of therapeutic connection,
thus deepening the working alliance. For instance, during NF-AP sessions as illustrated in Figure 2.C,
both therapist and patient might observe increased neural synchrony (i.e., correlated increases in the
visualized fMRI signal from the targeted brain region) during moments of significant emotional
exchange, reflecting the occurrence of an empathic connection. Such synchronic might guide therapists
in modulating their interventions to strengthen the therapeutic bond. Similarly, patients can gain insight
into their own neural responses to therapy, promoting self-awareness and enhancing engagement with
the therapeutic process. Moreover, NF-AP can serve as an educational tool for therapists in training,
heightening their sensitivity to the neurobiological aspects of empathy and connection.
Accordingly, there have been attempts to match patients to therapists on the basis of
compatible personality characteristics to further improve upon it (Gunderson, 1978). Positive therapist
and patient perceptions of the quality of the therapeutic relationship are correlated with clinical
improvement, and discrepancies in the quality this rating have been negatively correlated with patient
outcomes (Cooley and Lajoy, 1980). This suggests that having objective markers of the quality of a


27
therapeutic relationship might be of potential therapeutic value at various stages of the
psychotherapeutic process. One question then is: what type of objective markers might neurofeedback
approaches provide?
A potential avenue for inquiry is the degree of interactional synchrony between therapist and
patient (i.e., temporally coupled activation between specific regions of each individuals brain during the
communication process). Interactional synchrony has been correlated to joint attention, which has been
implicated in theory of mind and empathy (Dumas et al., 2011). It might occur in a mirrored fashion
between the same regions (e.g., anterior insular cortex activity in one person influencing anterior insular
cortex activity in the other; rTPJ activity in client synched with rTPJ in therapist (Zhang et al., 2018;
Zhang et al., 2020)). Another potential finding may be asynchronous but complimentary patterns that
emerge during social interaction, whereby delayed effects occur, or effects are identified between
different brain regions (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex activity in one individual influencing amygdala
activity in the other individual; mid/posterior insular cortex of the patient with chronic pain influencing
the anterior insular cortex of the therapist (Ellingsen et al., 2022)).
On the other hand, NF-AP may be most effective in the application of CBT or DBT, which
inherently focus on changing negative patterns and emotional regulation. This is because neurofeedback
provides real-time feedback on brain activity, allowing for the modification of neural patterns associated
with specific behaviors or thought processes. It aligns well with CBT, which focuses on identifying and
changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. Additionally, therapies that focus on emotional
regulation such as DBT, may benefit from neurofeedback because it can help patients recognize and
regulate emotional responses. Its capacity to aid in self-regulation and awareness makes neurofeedback
a valuable tool in these therapy forms. Furthermore, neurofeedback tools are capable of quantifying
certain neural elements of the dyad through explicit visualization of regional neural activity reflecting
information such as the degree of 1) motor synchronization (e.g., gaze, facial expression), 2) speech


28
synchronization (e.g., voice-tone, voice-speed, spacing such as pause, silence, and parroting), 3)
physiological synchronization (e.g., breathing), 4) putative inner-experience synchronization (e.g.,
mirroring, empathy, Theory of Mind), or 5) emotional regulation (e.g., responses to feeling upset,
anxious, sad, or angry). Neurofeedback delivery of connectivity metrics (i.e., real-time indicators of the
degree of correlated neural activity between two or more networked regions of an individual) is a more
recent application (Tsuchiyagaito et al., 2023; Tsuchiyagaito et al., 2021a). As a form of neurofeedback,
this information might allow the therapist to assess their patient’s neural activity directly and perhaps
use it to optimize their communication with them (Figure 2). Conversely, neurofeedback might enable a
patient to directly access their therapist’s brain activity in order to observe their neural response to
information at critical junctures in the conversation. This form of NF-AP represents a departure from
standard neurofeedback delivery in which the user accesses their own neural activity and attempts to
manipulate it. This is because, in each case, the user is only accessing the neural activity of their
counterpart and utilizing that information as they communicate with their counterpart. In the following
sections we elaborate upon potential applications of NF-AP.
3.5 Integrating neurofeedback into psychotherapy
From a pragmatic perspective, we are not suggesting that NF-AP should be investigated for use
in every session, as this could be disruptive and certainly infeasible from a cost/resource’s perspective.
Rather, we propose that studies could evaluate its use at judicious timepoints, such as during the onset
or termination of psychotherapy, or during other important milestones. Another application includes
the use of standard neurofeedback as an augmenting tool to punctuate therapy with self-selection or
algorithmic selection of specific neural regulation strategies that could further enhance a patient’s
response to standard of care psychotherapies (Figure 4). Some initial goals of doing so within the
context of psychotherapy might be to 1) identify objective measures associated with patient symptoms


29
or the quality of a psychotherapeutic relationship, 2) use these markers to make predictions about the
psychotherapy treatment outcome, or 3) implement these predictions to guide the selection of
psychotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore, NF-AP can be used to identify moments when the patient
feels understood or when the therapist feels they have made a breakthrough, thereby reinforcing the
therapeutic bond and working alliance. Next, we consider several possible stages at which
neurofeedback might be investigated in service of these goals (Table 5).
Figure 4: Potential applications of neurofeedback-assisted psychotherapy (NF-AP). 1) A therapist begins by assessing the patient’s symptoms. 2) Based on the assessment, the therapist selects a neurofeedback brain region of interest (ROI) such as A. Ventromedical prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), B. Insular cortex, or C. Amygdala, putatively involved in the pathophysiological expression of the disorder. 3) The neurofeedback ROI is then paired with various mental strategies (e.g., A. recalling autobiographical happy memories, B. evocative music listening, C. imaginal exposure to specific images) selected by the


30
therapist to help the patient modulate the activity within the ROI. The therapist and patient iteratively discuss the potential application of mental strategies to optimize the neural response in the ROI, for example, recalling happy memories to address anhedonia related to amygdala activity. 4) Using a brainbased measurement tool (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG)), neural signals from the patient’s ROI are recorded while the patient employs these strategies. 5) Both the therapist and patient review the neurofeedback effects in terms of changed or unchanged neural regulation, particularly in relation to the patient’s symptoms. In the case of unchanged regulation, the process is repeated, perhaps switching the selected ROI or mental strategy until achievement of increased regulation or symptom resolution. 6) Upon successful achievement of the targeted outcome (e.g., symptom reduction) or lack thereof, NF-AP treatment is ended. Black arrows represent the procedural workflow and decision-making process for choosing ROIs and self-regulation strategies.
Prior to psychotherapy
Therapist selection is already known to commonly proceed based on preferred demographic
characteristics such as therapist sex, age, therapy modality and/or degree of experience perceived by
the patient (Johnson et al., 2018). One application of NF-AP could be to help optimize the selection of
the therapist-patient dyad, perhaps by using proximal neural markers of empathic engagement during a
scripted interaction. While this is currently a tentative consideration given the paucity of available
studies, there is data to suggest that initial empathic responses during psychotherapy correlate
positively to good psychotherapy outcomes (Malin and Pos, 2015). Current paradigms for measuring the
therapeutic relationship are based on therapist and patient self-report, observer report, or analysis of
vocal or language style synchrony (Imel et al., 2014; Lord et al., 2015). By providing direct measures of
brain activity associated with empathic interactions between a potential patient and therapist, NF-AP
might be studied as a tool to augment the patient’s and therapist’s initial determination of whether they
are a ‘good match’. However, we would emphasize that this conceptual suggestion is not meant as a
replacement. It is rather speculative, and more research would be needed in order to determine what
activation in various regions means (i.e., at this stage it would be difficult to trust insula
activation/synchrony as a more precise measure of the therapeutic relationship than the client and
therapist’s self-report, or objective ratings of the conversation). Another potential avenue of inquiry


31
would be to investigate utility of dyadic synchrony at the initial stages of treatment in prediction of
patient outcomes.
During psychotherapy
One could argue that introducing an objective measure which relates to the quality of a
therapeutic relationship may be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of a course of psychotherapy.
There are two perspectives to consider in weighing the potential utility of investigating neurofeedback
during psychotherapy – that of the therapist, and that of the patient. A psychotherapist may be able to
use neurofeedback derived signals to assess whether their attempts to build rapport are successful. In
addition, a psychotherapist might be able to receive a continuous feed of neural activity data to assess
the degree of a patient’s neural engagement during the therapy session, or key portions of it. On the
other hand, a patient might be able to use such data derived from their therapist’s brain as objective
reassurance that an empathic response has occurred, which may be particularly useful for some
individuals at the induction of therapy or during key portions of a therapeutic session. From an insight
oriented perspective, patients might also be able to use this feedback to learn what an empathic
response in another person looks and sounds like, and/or to retrain an empathic misperception. It
seems plausible that such tools might prove useful in either improving the quality of long-term
psychotherapeutic interactions (e.g., during psychodynamic psychotherapy), or for shorter-term
therapies (e.g., manualized CBT, or even intensive short term psychodynamic therapy [ISTDP] (Caldiroli
et al., 2020; Hoviatdoost et al., 2022)). Whether such an approach could reduce the number of sessions
needed to achieve a standard clinical outcome, or alternately, to improve clinical outcomes, is unknown.
While therapists are trained to have empathic awareness towards their patients, perhaps gaining further
insight into the processes that underlie empathy and monitoring these in real time may provide
information before either party is consciously aware of it and facilitate greater levels of insight and self


32
awareness on the part of both participants. Alternatively, NF-AP might be utilized as an instructive tool
during training to help a therapist to be aware of their own countertransference to a patient at the level
of their neural circuit responses during an exchange, either in real time (via display on a screen), or
afterwards (in a didactic session with a training instructor). Despite the novelty of these potential
applications, we should emphasize that adding other cognitive tasks into an already demanding and
engrossing interaction carries the risk of distracting or diluting a therapist’s ability to be fully attentive
and engaged to their patients’ verbal and nonverbal responses. Thus, we consider these potential
applications of NF-AP to be best studied as additive or augmenting approaches.
At the conclusion of psychotherapy
Evaluation of NF-AP data at the conclusion of psychotherapy could allow for objective
assessments of change in neural activity relative to the starting point, as well as correlative assessments
of the degree of improvement in neural engagement (in the patient or therapist) and clinical outcomes.
When combined with long term outcomes, this might be useful in informing the risk of relapse.
Prediction of poor outcomes via low neural engagement might be another possibility worth
investigating, especially in instances where the patient/therapist rate a high initial or sustained
therapeutic bond. Lastly, therapists may consider the timing of introducing NF-AP in psychotherapy. For
example, it might be beneficial during initial sessions to establish working alliance or during challenging
moments when breakthroughs are critical. It is also important to note that while NF-AP has a potential
to augment psychotherapy, it should not replace fundamental therapeutic skills and should be used
judiciously to complement the therapist’s expertise.

3.6 Critical Challenges in Neurofeedback Technology
Before addressing the complexities of interpersonal dynamics and feasibility of NF-AP, it is
important to acknowledge and address the unresolved technical, conceptual, and practical challenges
within the neurofeedback field. These challenges could pose serious limitations to the different
conceptual applications described here. In the following section, we will provide a summary of these
challenges.
Technical Challenges of Neurofeedback in Clinical Practice
Neurofeedback systems rely on the accurate measurement and interpretation of brain signals, where
the quality of signal acquisition depends on the equipment used such as EEG or fMRI. The presence of
artifacts in the neurofeedback signal, stemming from physiological noises such as heartbeat, respiration,
and movement, can significantly distort the feedback provided to the patient (Heunis et al., 2020; Misaki
and Bodurka, 2021; Thibault et al., 2018; Weiss et al., 2020). Feedback contaminated with artifacts can
lead to a misrepresentation of the patient’s brain activity, which may hamper the learning process and
potentially reinforce maladaptive neural patterns.


34
Efforts to address these challenges have included the development of rtfMRI frameworks and
consensus on reporting detailed processing and experimental setups (Ros et al., 2020). For example, the
RTPSpy software library provides a customized rtfMRI system, with a comprehensive image processing
pipeline with an option for physiological noise corrections and an interface for real-time brain activation
signal reception (Misaki et al., 2022). The application of sophisticated signal processing techniques and
artifact correction methods is essential to ensure the integrity of the neurofeedback signal.
Conceptual Challenges in Neurofeedback Mechanisms
The underlying potential mechanism of neurofeedback assumes a direct and linear relationship between
neurophysiological processing and psychological states. This assumption could be an oversimplification,
given the brain’s complexity and the dynamic nature. The neuromodulatory mechanisms of
neurofeedback are not fully understood, leading to an active debate concerning the specificity and
longevity of neurofeedback-induced brain changes (Ciccarelli et al., 2023; Melnikov, 2021; Paret et al.,
2019; Sokunbi, 2017; Taschereau-Dumouchel et al., 2022; Tursic et al., 2020; Zuberer et al., 2015).
Moreover, neurofeedback interventions are based on the concept of neuroplasticity; however, the
extent and conditions under which neuroplastic changes can be guided through neurofeedback remain
topics of ongoing research (Paret et al., 2019; Taschereau-Dumouchel et al., 2022).
The selection of the target regions/circuit for neurofeedback training is another pivotal aspect,
where a choice significantly impacts the outcome of the intervention. An inappropriate target selection
may result in suboptimal or even adverse effects. For example, enhancing brain functions in a
maladaptive neural activity or circuit could potentially exacerbate symptoms, especially in complex
psychiatric conditions (Nagappan et al., 2021). The effective translation of neurofeedback into
psychotherapeutic practice necessitates a nuanced understanding of these conceptual challenges. It


35
requires the development of refined neurofeedback protocols that are adaptable to individual
complexities and can accurately influence psychological states in a therapeutically beneficial manner.
Practical Challenges in Neurofeedback Implementation
Beyond laboratory-based demonstrations of efficacy, the technical delivery of neurofeedback in
real-world settings would also need to be improved substantially. In practice, the methodological
differences in aspects such as the selection of the target brain signals (as we mentioned above), the
selection of feedback modality (audio, visual, or tactile), and the duration and frequency of the sessions
can all impact the efficacy of neurofeedback (Ros et al., 2020). A notable practical challenge is the
substantial variability in individual responses to neurofeedback. While some individuals can successfully
learn to modulate their neural activity, others may struggle to achieve meaningful volitional control
(Alkoby et al., 2018; Haugg et al., 2021; Kadosh and Staunton, 2019; Tursic et al., 2020; Weber et al.,
2020; Zuberer et al., 2015). This variability is influenced by a multitude of factors, including baseline
cognitive functioning, psychological state, and the existence of neurological or psychiatric conditions.
Differences in brain anatomy and physiology, such as cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and
neurotransmitter receptor distribution, could affect neurofeedback learning rates and outcomes (Haugg
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Misaki et al., 2019; Ninaus et al., 2015; Tsuchiyagaito et al., 2021b; Weber et
al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). However, the literature has yet to fully explore and integrate these
individual differences. In a clinical context, this inter-subject variability presents multiple challenges.
Tailoring neurofeedback protocols to each individual’s neurocognitive profile is important, and the
integration of adaptive algorithms may be necessary to modify protocols responsively based on the
patient’s progress.
The need for basic patient knowledge in interpreting NF-AP involves educating patients to
understand the meaning of feedback as a read-out from their neural signal images. This education is


36
crucial as NF-AP relies on patients’ ability to comprehend and respond to real-time feedback from their
brain activity. Effective NF-AP requires patients to recognize patterns in their neural data, understand
what these patterns signify regarding their mental state, and learn how to alter these patterns through
therapeutic techniques. This process could empower patients to actively engage in their psychotherapy.
Moreover, a critical role of therapists in the neurofeedback process is to educate and manage patient
expectations, emphasizing that not achieving self-regulation is not indicative of personal failure. There
must be clear communication that while neurofeedback offers promising benefits, it may not be
universally effective for all patients (Nagappan et al., 2021).
Financial and Logistical Barriers to Neurofeedback Integration
The implementation of neurofeedback, especially fMRI-based neurofeedback, involves
substantial costs related to the equipment, maintenance, and the operation of advanced neuroimaging
technologies (Thibault and Raz, 2017; Tursic et al., 2020). These costs can significantly exceed those
associated with traditional psychotherapeutic interventions and raise important questions about the
cost-benefit ratio of such an approach. Beyond the direct costs, neurofeedback requires therapists to
undergo specialized training, which may pose barriers to widespread adoption. This training goes
beyond traditional psychotherapy curricula and involves understanding the technical aspects of
neuroimaging, data analysis, and the operation of neurofeedback equipment.
The logistical demands of neurofeedback pose significant challenges to equitable access in
mental health care. The necessity for specialized equipment and a controlled environment, coupled with
the need for sophisticated technical support, translates into high operational costs. These costs can
create service availability gaps, disproportionately affecting those in socioeconomically disadvantaged or
geographically isolated areas. Consequently, state-of-the-art approach like neurofeedback may become
exclusive to individuals and communities with ample financial resources.


37
It is important to emphasize that these limitations pose a critical barrier to current or near-term
clinical application. Thus, in order for the concepts articulated here to appreciably move towards
integration within clinical settings, a number of advances must occur. These include methodologic
improvements (i.e., improved signal processing, refined ROI specification, efficient denoising),
technological hurdles overcome (i.e., device-based “bolt-on” application capable of pairing with a
variety of MRI scanners, user-friendly setup and response detection interface), deployment (attentional
training instruction, personalized trait-based selection at the individual level, standardized criteria for
discerning trial-by-trial improvement), and evidence base (multiple clinical trials demonstrating efficacy
for a given condition).
4. Limitations and Future Directions of NF-AP
Once foundational challenges are addressed, further obstacles become apparent in the specific
application of NF-AP as a tool for enhancing the patient-therapist relationship. The first obstacle is
establishing a definitive and reliable neural signature for empathy. Such a signature could be potentially
influenced by individual difference variables such as a patient or therapist demographic characteristics
(e.g., socioeconomic status, racial or ethnic origin, language fluency), or the type of psychotherapy being
practiced (e.g., empathic communications during psychodynamic therapy may by quite differ from those
provided during cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy). Non-verbal expressions of
empathy can also differ across cultures (Lorie et al., 2017), suggesting that cultural compatibility could
be another factor needing to be considered. A related challenge is reliably determining which neural
markers are directly associated with therapeutic improvement, particularly given the limited test-retest
reliability that has been demonstrated with certain fMRI-based tasks. It is also possible to imagine
situations where a strong empathic connection (and the associated neural indicators) may be present in
the absence of psychotherapeutic improvement. From the therapist’s perspective, inordinate empathy


38
may undermine objectivity or could perhaps lead to ‘compassion fatigue’ (Stefanello, 2022). It may also
be the case that certain components of empathy (e.g., the cognitive as opposed to the affective aspects)
are better indicators of a successful therapeutic alliance (Decety, 2020).
While an empathetic patient-therapist relationship is considered central to patient
improvement in traditional forms of psychotherapy, newer forms have also emerged that do not
emphasize in-person communication. For example, internet-based psychotherapy has shown efficacy in
reducing mental health symptoms in several psychopathologies (Andrews and Williams, 2014; Seyffert
et al., 2016), indicating that the empathic relationship between two people is not the only mechanism of
change in psychotherapy. Finally, the success of animal-assisted psychotherapies, particularly with
domesticated animals, such as dogs and horses, who have evolved to perceive emotional cues from
humans (Nurenberg et al., 2015) raises additional opportunities for inquiry into the allospecific versus
conspecific mechanisms of empathy.
Neurofeedback (especially fMRI-based neurofeedback for dyadic interaction) is a time-intensive,
expensive, and complicated approach. The fMRI environment and associated noise can be distracting,
and the limited facial feedback imposed by head coils could be barriers to verbal and non-verbal aspects
of communication, although this would be less of a concern for EEG applications. Social interactions and
expressions of empathy unfold across millisecond timescales (e.g., slight movements of the mouth or
eyebrows; a sigh; a blink; a change in vocal prosody; etc.) whereas fMRI feedback is delayed by at least 4
to 6 seconds due to the physiology of the hemodynamic response function (Oblak et al., 2017). Such
delays in feedback would need to be believably incorporated into ongoing interpersonal interactions.
Beyond laboratory-based demonstrations of efficacy, the technical delivery of neurofeedback in real
world settings would also need to be improved substantially. Addressing these technological hurdles
must consider broader translation and accessible delivery with respect to cost. However, the value of
the potential knowledge to be gained regarding the neural basis of how empathic interactions lead to


39
improved health outcomes suggests that this approach may be worth investigating from the initial
standpoint of scientific inquiry. Incorporating a personalized medicine approach into neurofeedback
research could lead to more sophisticated and effective interventions. This may involve multimodal
assessments that combine neuroimaging, genetic, cognitive, and behavioral data to create
comprehensive profiles, guiding individualized neurofeedback treatments. The significant and complex
issue of inter-subject variability in neurofeedback efficacy also provides an opportunity to enhance our
understanding of the brain-behavior relationship and refine neurofeedback as a therapeutic modality.
By embracing this variability, we can progress toward a more personalized approach in neurofeedback
application, thereby enhancing its therapeutic potential in psychotherapy. In the technical realm, the
field is advancing from group-level-based target selection to individualized target selection (Taschereau
Dumouchel et al., 2022). The importance of individualized target selection in neurofeedback, which may
involve baseline neuroimaging assessments to tailor protocols to an individual’s unique neural
architecture and functional characteristics, is becoming increasingly recognized. The potential for
advanced machine learning techniques to analyze individual patterns of neural activity promises to
further enhance the personalization of neurofeedback interventions.
In addition to the aforementioned limitations, to reach a point in which NF-AP is truly feasible
and helpful in actual clinical practice, it will be essential to establish (1) what the brain signal of interest
means, (2) what needs to happen to that brain signal to enhance the relationships and/or therapy
outcomes (i.e., up regulate, down regulate, synchronize), (3) when does that change in brain signal need
to happen (e.g., at all times versus only when experiencing strong emotions? early versus late in
therapy?), (4) what the therapist and/or patient can do to influence change in the brain signal (e.g. what
verbal or nonverbal actions would be useful for doing so), (5) and whether there are factors to consider
in personalization to each individual client (e.g., what is “optimal” for one person may not be optimal for
another). Each of these aspects calls for a plethora of additional research, which will likely need to be


40
done in an iterative fashion, and with input from stakeholders (e.g., patients, clinicians) at each step to
help support eventual practical utility.
5. Conclusion
Neurofeedback-assisted psychotherapy (NF-AP) is a novel neuroscience-informed approach to
psychotherapy with potential applications for identifying neural markers of engagement during
psychotherapy and for potentially shedding light on how empathic human interactions may help to
facilitate improvements in mental health. The integration of neurofeedback into psychotherapy provides
a unique opportunity to amplify the therapeutic relationship. NF-AP can enhance this relationship by: (1)
allowing therapists to observe and respond to objective, real-time feedback on their patients’
neurological responses, facilitating a more dynamic and responsive therapeutic process; and (2)
empowering patients by giving them a more active role in their treatment through self-regulation,
potentially increasing engagement and treatment adherence. Providing both therapist and patient with
a shared language and visual representation of psychological states, which can be particularly valuable
in expressing and understanding abstract concepts like emotions and thought patterns (Paret and
Hendler, 2020).
To fully assess whether NF-AP is the most cost-effective means to enhance the patient-therapist
relationship and therapy effectiveness, it is necessary to measure the value of NF-AP not solely in cost
aspects but also in its capacity to improve therapeutic outcomes. Does NF-AP provide a significant
enough improvement in therapy to warrant its cost, and can these improvements be sustained long
term? Can NF-AP lead to improvements that are unachievable through traditional methods alone?
Those should be answered in future studies.
