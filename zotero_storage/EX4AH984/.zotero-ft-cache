Abstract
Objective: The quality of working alliance (WA) is associated with treatment out
comes across several types of psychiatric disorders and psychological interventions.
This study examined the role of WA with peer mentors (people with lived experience
of illness) and student mentors (graduated psychology students) in a 6-week, digital,
guided self-help (GSH) intervention for anorexia nervosa.
Method: Ninety-nine patients rated weekly, for 6 weeks: (a) eating psychopathology
using the short version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-QS)
and (b) WA with a student mentor (n = 14) or a peer mentor (n = 10). WA was
assessed by asking patients the extent to which they felt comfortable working with
their mentor and the extent to which they agreed with them on the goals for support.
WA with mentors and the association with eating psychopathology change were
measured on a session-by-session basis. The analysis involved a random intercepts
cross-lagged panel model.
Results: WA with peer mentors was slightly higher than WA with students
(ES = 0.3). Peer mentors' WA in the previous session was significantly associated
with eating psychopathology ratings in the next session. No significant relationship
was found between the previous session's EDE-QS scores and peer mentor alliance
in the following session. In the student mentor group, there were no session-by
session associations between WA and eating psychopathology. However, greater
WA with the student mentor across sessions was associated with less eating
psychopathology.
Discussion: These findings suggest that clinical outcomes are in part associated with
the characteristics of the mentor delivering guidance in an online GSH for eating
disorders.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Digital therapies have been largely tested in the field of eating disor
ders for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorders
(Beintner, Jacobi, & Schmidt, 2014; Schlegl, Bürger, Schmidt, Herbst, &
Voderholzer, 2015). Guided self-help (GSH) is recommended for these
conditions by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE, 2017). GSH programs have the potential to supplement stan
dard treatment through a variety of formats and modalities (face to
face or online) usually involving mentors with past experiences of the
illness or nonprofessionals. To date, GSH and digital interventions
have been less studied in anorexia nervosa (AN), with experts in the
field expressing concerns for patients’ safety (Wilson & Zandberg,
2012). Interestingly, recent meta-analytic results demonstrate that the
use of GSH in AN is associated with reduced drop-out rates compared
to Specialist Supportive Clinical Management or Treatment as usual
(TAU) (OR [95% CI] = 0.63[0.41–0.95]), although there were only
small effects for changes in body mass index (BMI), depression and
anxiety (ES of 0.08, 0.07, and 0.03; Albano, Hodsoll, Kan, Lo
Coco, & Cardi, 2019). In this study, we use data from the Self-Help
and Recovery guide for Eating Disorders (SHARED) trial (which was
one of the studies included in Albano et al., 2019). The SHARED trial
tested the use of a 6-week digital GSH intervention to augment TAU
for AN (i.e., RecoveryMANTRA; Cardi et al., 2015).
In the SHARED trial, RecoveryMANTRA guidance was provided
by peer mentors (individuals with lived experience of eating disorders)
or student mentors, with the overall goal of sharing information and
encouraging behavior change. Patients receiving RecoveryMANTRA
in addition to TAU reported a greater reduction in anxiety (small
effect size) at the end of the intervention (6 weeks), but not at follow
up (6 months), compared to TAU only (Cardi et al., 2019). Further
more, patients receiving RecoveryMANTRA in addition to TAU
reported greater confidence in their own ability to change (small
effect size) and greater alliance with their mentor at the outpatient
clinic (small-to-medium effect size) at 6 weeks, compared to the TAU
only group (Cardi et al., 2019). Patients who dropped-out early from
the intervention were less satisfied with the online guidance received
from the mentor delivering guidance at the end of the first week
(Cardi et al., 2020). These results indicate that further research is
needed to establish how effective mentoring strategies can be
implemented in digital GSH for AN. In the current study, we examined
how working alliance (WA) with the mentors delivering online guid
ance in the SHARED trial impacted on eating psychopathology.
The concept of WA includes the quality of the emotional bond
established in the therapeutic dyad and also patient–therapist agree
ment about the goals of therapy (Zilcha-Mano & Errazuriz, 2017). The
relation of WA and treatment outcomes has been consistently
evidenced across different psychotherapy treatments, and a meta
analysis of 18 studies supported a predictive relation between alliance
and outcomes (d = 0.57) in e-mental health, with therapy delivered
via Internet, e-mail, or videoconferencing (Flückiger, Del Re,
Wampold, & Horvath, 2018). In the eating disorder field, a recent
meta-analysis of 20 studies suggested that there is a bi-directional
relationship between symptom reduction and alliance in the early
phase of treatment, especially for younger patients with AN (Graves
et al., 2017). All the studies included in the meta-analysis considered
WA with a professional delivering therapy. Less clear is the impact of
WA with less specialized individuals, including peer mentors, on clini
cal outcomes from GSH. Recently, there has been growing interest in
understanding of how recovered individuals, also defined as peer
mentors, can contribute to clinical change. There is some indication
that peer mentorship can help patients feeling understood and
improve clinical outcomes and treatment attendance (Beveridge et al.,
2019; Perez, Van Diest, & Cutts, 2014; Ramjan, Fogarty, Nicholls, &
Hay, 2018). A recent pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining
the feasibility and efficacy of peer mentorship for individuals with an
eating disorder found a preference for, and higher engagement with
peer mentors, compared to general social support mentorship
(Ranzenhofer et al., 2020).
The current study is the first to examine the role of WA with both
peer mentors and psychology student mentors over the course of dig
ital online GSH for AN. We conducted a process analysis of data from
the SHARED trial, with the overall goal of examining the association
between WA with a student mentor or peer mentor and eating disor
der outcomes, on a session-by-session basis. It is worth noting that
the evidence on the association between WA and outcome in the
treatment of EDs is still inconsistent across diagnoses, treatments,
and time of assessment (Brauhardt, de Zwaan, & Hilbert, 2014; Graves
et al., 2017), and there is a lack of research examining the role of WA
for AN patient improvement across sessions. This is one of the first
papers to explore day-by-day associations between WA and out
comes in eating disorders.
Zilcha-Mano (2020) distinguished between trait-like and state
like measures of WA. Trait-like WA captures patients' ability to form
an alliance with the therapist or mentor and constitutes the
between-patient aspect of WA because it involves averaging WA
across multiple occasions (Zilcha-Mano, 2020). State-like WA
describes, instead, the within-patient aspect of WA, which changes
over time and has direct and specific associations with clinical out
comes (Zilcha-Mano, 2020). The current study aimed to examine
the contribution of trait- and state-like WA in the treatment of
patients with AN.
In this study, patients in the intervention arm (Rec
overyMANTRA + TAU) had access to self-help materials (workbook
and short video-clips) and received weekly online chat-based guid
ance from a student mentor (i.e., a trained postgraduate student of
psychology) or from a peer mentor (i.e., a recovered patient who suf
fered from an eating disorder). Patients were assigned to a mentor
by the study team, based on mentors' availability, and patients did
not choose nor were they randomized to a mentor type. Based on
the literature on WA, we examined whether (a) higher alliance with
the mentor/peer mentor in a session would predict lower eating psy
chopathology in the following session, and (b) the causal association
between WA and eating psychopathology would be stronger for
patients assigned to a peer mentor compared to those assigned to a
postgraduate student mentor.

2 | METHOD
This is a process data analysis from a multicenter randomized clinical
trial for outpatients with a diagnosis of AN. The trial tested the effi
cacy of RecoveryMANTRA, a digital, 6-week GSH intervention facili
tated by student mentors or peer mentors. The trial design consisted
of testing RecoveryMANTRA in addition to TAU versus TAU alone.
Participants, who were randomly allocated to the intervention arm
(RecoveryMANTRA + TAU condition), received self-help materials
and weekly guidance from mentors to supplement their TAU. The
weekly guidance was delivered by mentors 1 hr/week, for 6 weeks,
using online texting on a secure platform. The self-help materials
included a collection of short video clips and a self-care workbook.
The intervention materials were developed with the goal to increase
confidence to change, internal motivation, connectedness to others,
and hope. In the RecoveryMANTRA + TAU condition, patients were
allocated to mentors on the basis of mentors' availability. Patients
were blind to the type of mentoring they had been assigned to, and
mentors were instructed not to reveal whether they had suffered
from an eating disorder in the past. Participants allocated to the con
trol group received the TAU provided by their participating centers
(e.g., group-based psychoeducation, individual psychotherapy, nutri
tional support, and medical monitoring). Full details of the study pro
tocol are reported in Cardi et al. (2015), and the main outcome
findings are reported in Cardi et al. (2019). The study involved
human participants and was reviewed and approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of London-Brent.
2.1 | Participants
Participants were involved in the trial if they met the following
inclusion criteria: (a) they were aged 16 or over; (b) had a diagnosis
of AN, or atypical or subclinical AN, based on the criteria of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013); and a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2
or below; and (c) they had been referred, at the time of the recruit
ment, to 1 of the 22 UK outpatient eating disorder centers that par
ticipated in the trial.
Participants were considered ineligible if they had (a) insufficient
knowledge of English; (b) severe mental or physical illness needing
treatment (i.e., psychosis or diabetes mellitus); and/or (c) did not
have access to the Internet. For the purposes of the present study,
only patients in the treatment arm (RecoveryMANTRA + TAU) were
included into the analysis. These were 99 participants (97%
were female), with a mean age of 26.60 (8.46) and 15.59 (2.83)
years of education. At baseline assessment, 67/99 (74.4%) of
patients had started outpatient treatment, their average BMI was
16.06 (1.44) and mean illness duration was 7.24 (8.81) years. Forty
one participants (47.1%) were using psychiatric medications and
22 (25.9%) had had previous hospital admissions for their eating
disorder.
2.2 | Mentors/peer mentors
Twenty-four mentors were engaged in the trial; 10 were individuals
recovered from an eating disorder and 14 (2 male) were postgradu
ate psychology students who provided weekly online guidance
through 1:1 synchronous chat sessions (i.e., online texting) for
6 weeks. All were aged above 19. All mentors attended training in
motivational interviewing and received 1:1 weekly supervision by
clinical psychologists and high-qualified professionals in eating disor
ders for the whole duration of their involvement in the project.
Online guidance was delivered once/week, for 6 weeks, through 1:1
written chat on the IESO Digital Health online platform (http://
www.iesohealth.com). The goal of the online sessions was to guide
participants through the use of the RecoveryMANTRA materials
(workbook and short video-clips). These materials were based on
the cognitive interpersonal model of AN (Schmidt & Treasure, 2006;
Treasure & Schmidt, 2013) and were aimed at providing psycho
education and support goal setting in four areas: emotion regulation,
social connection, cognitive flexibility, and healthy eating. In the
treatment arm, patients were allocated to mentors on the basis of
mentorship availability; that is, the maximum case load was three
participants/mentor, from April, 2015 to December, 2016 (recruit
ment time).
2.3 | Measures
Patients rated their eating psychopathology on a weekly basis, for
6 weeks, using the short version of the Eating Disorder Examination
Questionnaire (EDE-QS; Gideon et al., 2016). The original version of
the EDE-QS showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .91)
and temporal stability (ICC = 0.93; p = <.001), and was highly cor
related with the original EDE-Q (Fairburn & Beglin, 1994; Gideon
et al., 2016). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha for the EDE-QS
total score was .81. Patients rated the perceived alliance with the
mentor/peer mentor on a weekly basis, for 6 weeks, using a two
item ultra-brief visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1 (never) to
7 (always). The items were “How often do you feel comfortable
working with your mentor?” and “How often do you and your men
tor agree on what needs to be done to improve your situation”?
These items were adapted from the session rating scale used by
Duncan et al. (2003) to measure bond and agreement on task. The
two items were averaged to create a composite alliance score, and
Cronbach's alpha values for the six time points ranged between .89
and .93.
2.4 | Data analyses
We used the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM:
Hamaker, Kuiper, & Grasman, 2015), implemented in Mplus. RI-CLPM
models between-patient effects by including a random intercept for
ALBANO ET AL. 1521


each of the variables (mentor/peer mentor alliance and EDE-QS) (i.e., a
factor with the six time loadings constrained to 1). This analysis is
important with nested data sets with three levels (i.e., time [Level 1],
patients [Level 2], and mentors/peer mentors [Level 3]). The random
intercept in the CLPM removes between-person variance (i.e., Level 2)
such that the lagged relationships in the RI-CLPM characterize
within-person change over time (i.e., Level 1; Hamaker et al., 2015).
To address the nesting of patients within mentors/peer mentors, we
followed the suggestion of McNeish, Stapleton, and Silverman (2017)
and estimated cluster robust-standard errors for Level 3 (mentor
level). We used the grouping command in Mplus to estimate sepa
rate RI-CLPM models for the student mentor and peer mentor
groups.
Three fit indices were used to evaluate the fit of the model: the
comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).
According to the recommendations from Hu and Bentler (1999),
criteria for acceptable fit have ranged from CFI ≥0.90 and SRMR and
RMSEA ≤0.10, to more conservative criteria of CFI ≥0.95, SRMR
≤0.08, and RMSEA ≤0.06.
We estimated two models, one with the auto-correlation and the
cross-lagged paths freely estimated and a second model with the 
auto-correlation (e.g., Alliance1 ! Alliance2 = Alliance2 ! Alliance3
= Alliance3 ! Alliance4...) and the cross-lagged paths constrained to
be equal across time periods (e.g., Alliance1 ! EDE-QS2 = Alliance2
! EDE-QS3 = Alliance3 ! EDE-QS4...). The Santorra–Bentler scaled
χ2 different test (Muthén & Muthén, 2017) examined the difference
between these nested models. Based on the parsimony principle, a
nonsignificant χ2 different test indicates that the constrained model
(i.e., the auto correlation and cross-lagged paths were set to be equal)
is the preferred model.
The χ2 different tests indicated the unconstrained model was not
a significantly better fit to the data than the constrained model (p
= .612). This constrained RI-CLPM model had an adequate fit (χ2 =
165.462, df = 118, p = .003, CFI = 0.961, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.091
[0.055, 0.122], SRMR = 0.109.
3 | RESULTS
Twenty-four mentors were recruited in the trial and each one
supported a range of 1–13 (mean = 11.12; SD = 6.94) participants.
Specifically, peer mentors (i.e., people with lived experience of the ill
ness, n = 10) assisted 40 patients, while student mentors (n = 14)
assisted 59 patients. The average rating of WA for peer mentors was
slightly higher (d = 0.34) (mean = 5.56, SD = 1.12); than the average
rating of WA for student mentors (mean = 5.13; SD = 1.32). The
mean eating psychopathology scores (EDE-Q) and BMI at baseline for
participants assigned to peer mentors were 3.90 (SD = 1.22) and
16.14 (SD = 1.46), respectively; while they were 4.12 (SD = 1.04) and
16.02 (SD = 1.45) for patients assigned to student mentors. There
was a small difference between groups for EDE-Q ratings at baseline
(d = 0.19), but not for the BMI (d = 0.08).
3.1 | Cross-lagged panel model for student mentors
For the student mentor group, the mentor WA across all six sessions
loaded significantly on the mentor WA random intercept (loadings
ranged from 0.521 to 0.662, ps < 0.001). EDE-QS ratings across the
six sessions loaded significantly on the EDE-QS random intercept
(loadings ranged from 0.667 to 0.744, ps < 0.001). Between-patient
student mentor WA correlated significantly and negatively with
between-patient EDE-QS, ( 0.33, t = 2.26, p = .024). Therefore,
when the trait-like (i.e., across the six sessions) WA with the student
mentor was stronger, patients reported less eating psychopathology.
Figure 1 displays the significant standardized auto correlations,
cross-lagged paths, and within-time period correlations. As seen in
Figure 1, there were significant stability auto-correlations for WA with
students, for all measurements (e.g., between Times 1 and 2; 0.31, t
= 5.82, p < .001). For student mentors, the cross-lagged paths
between early mentor alliance and later EDE-QS ratings were all small
and not significant (ps > 0.49). In addition, the cross-lagged paths
between early EDE-QS and later mentor alliance were all small and
not significant (ps > 0.50). Therefore, earlier mentor WA was not
related to later eating psychopathology and earlier eating psychopa
thology was not related to later mentor WA at any point in time. With
student mentors, state-like changes in WA were not related to lower
eating psychopathology. There were two types of cross-sectional rela
tionships between within-mentor WA and eating psychopathology; at
Session 1 ( 0.43, t = 3.50, p < .001) and Session 3 ( 0.34, t
= 2.01, p = .044), WA was negatively and significantly correlated
with EDE-QS. Stronger alliance during these sessions was associated
with less eating psychopathology at these sessions.
3.2 | Cross-lagged panel model for peer mentors
For the peer mentor group, peer mentor WA across all six sessions
loaded significantly on the mentor WA random intercept (loadings
ranged from 0.589 to 0.717, ps < .001). EDE-QS ratings across the six
sessions loaded significantly on the EDE-QS random intercept (load
ings ranged from 0.451 to 0.603, ps < .001). Between-patient mentor
WA correlated positively but not significantly with between-patient
EDE-QS (0.35, t = 1.84, p = .067). Therefore, there was no relation
ship between trait-like, peer mentor WA, and eating psychopathology.
Figure 1 displays the significant standardized auto correlations,
cross-lagged paths and within-time period correlations. As seen in
Figure 1, there was significant stability auto-correlations) for peer
mentor WA across all measurements, (e.g., between times 1 and 2
(0.27, t = 5.77, p < .001).
For peer mentors, the cross-lagged paths between early mentor
WA and later EDE-QS ratings were all significant (e.g., between times
1 and 2 ( 0.20, t = 3.98, p < .001). However, the cross-lagged paths
between early EDE-QS and later peer mentor WA were all small and
not significant (ps > 0.280). Therefore, if state-like, peer mentor WA
in a session was higher than usual, the eating psychopathology the

following session was lower than usual for the patient. However, ear
lier eating psychopathology was not related to later WA with the peer
mentor. With regard to cross-sectional relationships, at Session 1
( 0.43, t = 3.05, p = .002) WA with the peer mentor was negatively
and significantly correlated with EDE-QS. Stronger alliance at Session
1 was associated with less eating psychopathology in that session.
4 | DISCUSSION
This study analyzed the relationship between patients' perception of
WA with their mentors/peer mentors and eating disorder psychopa
thology assessed on a session-by-session basis, over the course of a
digital GSH intervention. The overall WA for the peer mentors was
slightly higher (small effect) than WA for student mentors. We found
a different temporal pattern of results for WA between student men
tors or peer mentors. The cross-lagged findings for the peer mentor
group indicated that higher within-patient WA in a session predicted
lower eating psychopathology in the following session. Regarding the
student mentor group, higher average patient's WA was associated
with reduced eating psychopathology across all sessions. However,
the cross-lagged panel results for student mentors showed that earlier
WA did not predict reduced eating symptoms the following session,
and that earlier eating psychopathology was not related to later WA
at any point in time. This is one of the first papers to explore the
weekly associations between WA and clinical outcomes of AN
patients undergoing GSH. Although the effectiveness of
psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with AN has been docu
mented (Zeeck et al., 2018), the outcomes and processes of change
associated with the use of GSH need to be further established within
this patient group (Traviss-Turner, West, & Hill, 2017; Albano
et al., 2019).
Previous research on the role of WA for patient improvement
reported mixed findings, with some research supporting the influence
of WA on patient symptom change ( Stiles-Shields et al., 2013), and
others suggesting the opposite (Brown, Mountford, & Waller, 2013).
One explanation for these mixed findings is the failure to separate the
effects of trait-like (between-patient) and state-like (within-patient)
WA. The present findings indicate that the temporal patterns of influ
ence between WA and the EDE-Q outcome can depend on the type
of mentorship received. In the current study, state-like WA between
patients and peer mentors with lived experience of the illness was
associated with symptom change on a session-by-session basis.
Although research on the role of peer mentorship in the treatment of
AN is still scarce, it was recently suggested that peer mentorship can
make patients feel understood and can provide sense of hope that
improvement is possible, fostering positive affect and hopefulness
(Ranzenhofer et al., 2020). Our findings add to this, suggesting that
peer mentors can help patients getting better by enhancing WA at
each session. It is possible that peer mentors acquired a relational
expertise, which stems from their own lived experience, which can be
useful to foster high patient engagement and a strong agreement on
tasks and goals on a session-by-session basis. On the other hand, our
findings suggest that student mentors are less effective to establish a
F I G U R E 1 Random intercept cross-lagged panel model with mentor alliance and eating psychopathology (EDE-QS) at Sessions 1–6. Only the within-person relationships are depicted in the figure. Estimates are standardized regression coefficients and covariances. Auto-regressive and cross-lagged paths were constrained to be time-invariant. The cross-lag relationships (lines between two points in time for different variables) depict the temporal ordering of variables. For example, if a patient's alliance increases between Week 2 and Week 3, compared to their own average WA change, do they decrease more in eating disorder symptoms from Weeks 3 and 4 than other weeks. The contemporaneous relationships (lines between two different variables at the same point in time) depict cross-sectional relationships. For example, if a patient's alliance increases between Week 2 and Week 3, compared to their own average WA change, do they also decrease more in eating disorder symptoms from Weeks 2 and 3 than other weeks. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001

strong WA with patients. These findings seem to support the impor
tance of distinguishing between trait-like and state-like components
of WA that characterize the individual patient (Zilcha-Mano &
Errazuriz, 2017). As described above, the trait-like component of
alliance refers to patient's ability to form satisfactory relationships
with others, and it is examined as mean alliance level that the
patient is able to form with the therapist (Zilcha-Mano, 2020). In
this regard, our findings indicate that this interpersonal ability is
especially important when patients work with student mentors. On
the other hand, the state-like component of the alliance refers to
changes in WA during treatment that can predict changes in clinical
outcomes. In this regard, our findings suggest that changes in the
state-like component of WA are the result of in-session work with
the peer mentor, which in turn contributes to better outcomes. The
distinction between WA with peer mentors or student mentors can
pave the road to optimizing treatment efficacy and personalizing
treatment (Zilcha-Mano, 2020), by offering peer mentorship for
those with lower state alliance particularly in the context of GSH.
Previous research in psychological treatments has demonstrated that
early WA between patient and therapist is associated with symptom
change in young patients with AN (Graves et al., 2017). Our findings
add to this literature demonstrating that this effect extends to adult
patients also, regardless of how psychological support is delivered
(online or face-to-face) (Berger, 2017; Sucala et al., 2012). More
over, our findings showed an association between higher WA and
lower eating symptoms at Session 1 both for the peer mentor and
student mentor groups. This result indicates the relevance of early
alliance in GSH for AN, and the importance of considering the
extent to which patients feel comfortable and in agreement with
their mentors/peer mentors at the beginning of treatment.
It is worth noting that when the WA with the student mentor
was higher, across all six sessions, patients reported more improve
ment in eating psychopathology. Therefore, patients with stronger
ability to build a positive WA with the student mentor are more
likely to get better in GSH. This finding is in line with the character
istics of GSH, where patients are required to take an active role in
driving the process of change (Falbe-Hansen, Le Huray, Phull,
Shakespeare, & Wheatley, 2009) and use their abilities and skills.
However, WA at each session did not predict symptom improve
ment the following session. This might be due to a lack of specific
therapeutic background for the mentor and repaired by additional
preparatory training. Indeed, a recent review on self-help in people
with binge eating (Beintner et al., 2014) highlighted that receiving
guidance from a specialized professional was associated with larger
intervention effects on some clinical outcomes than nonspecialist
guidance. Our cross-lagged panel results suggest that patients
receiving guidance from peer mentors are more responsive to
strengthen a positive alliance every session and this in turn fosters
an improvement of symptomatic behaviors the following week.
However, given the limited evidence on the process of change in
GSH for AN, further research is warranted to identify patient- and
mentors-related characteristics associated with clinical change
(Albano et al., 2019; Traviss-Turner et al., 2017).
4.1 | Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze patient
and mentor/peer mentor contributions to WA in predicting clinical
change in AN. We investigated the process of change over time, for
6 weeks, in the intervention arm of a large RCT of digital GSH in AN
(Cardi et al., 2019). Some limitations must be considered. Firstly, we
only measured self-reported eating psychopathology to measure clini
cal change. Further research is needed to test whether WA is associ
ated with different eating disorder outcome measures, such as BMI,
depression and anxiety (Albano et al., 2019). In this current study,
BMI was not included in the analyses because this information was
not ascertained on a weekly basis. However, measures of global eat
ing disorder psychopathology remain the most widely used to evalu
ate the efficacy of GSH in eating disorders (Traviss-Turner et al.,
2017). Secondly, nonstandardized VASs were used to assess
WA. Although brief assessments have many practical benefits for
repeated measurements compared to longer questionnaires, and our
VAS demonstrated excellent internal consistency across the time
points, a more comprehensive assessment of WA might better repre
sent the breadth of the construct. Previous studies in the field have
estimated that the shared variance among numerous measures of WA
in eating disorders is less than 50% (Graves et al., 2017), and therefore
further research is needed to establish which core measures of alli
ance would be most suitable to assess this construct over time. Fur
ther research is also needed to examine therapist ratings of alliance,
given the scarce availability of these data in the eating disorders field
(Brauhardt et al., 2014). Finally, further research with the aim of test
ing the differences in alliance between peer mentors and student
mentors should adopt random assignment of patients to these
conditions.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This study corroborates the importance of WA in GSH for AN. These
findings suggest that WA with peer mentors is slightly higher than
WA with student mentors. Most importantly, this study indicates that
WA is associated with clinical change when established with peer
mentors. Higher WA with peer mentors in a session predicted lower
than usual eating psychopathology in the following session, over
6 weeks. Given the limitations of this study, further research is
warranted to examine the specific peer mentor characteristics, which
can help patients in the process of therapeutic change.
