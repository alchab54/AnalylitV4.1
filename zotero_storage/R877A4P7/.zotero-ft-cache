Abstract
The arrival of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has confronted us with a global
and unprecedented challenge of community-wide psychological distress alongside
reduced access to therapeutic services in the traditional face-to-face format, due to
the need to self-isolate. This previously unimagineable set of circumstances provides
a unique opportunity, and indeed an imperative, for videotherapy to fulfil its potential
in addressing mental health and well-being needs from a distance. Historically, the
uptake of videotherapy has been hindered by psychotherapist expectations of infe
rior therapeutic alliance and outcomes, in spite of considerable research evidence to
the contrary. Research suggests that videotherapy provides a powerful pathway for
clients to experience enhanced opportunities for
self-expression, connection and intimacy. This more neutral therapeutic ‘space’ pro
vides clients with multifarious opportunities for self-awareness, creative experience
and collaboration, with potentially a greater sense of agency over their own experi
ence. This paper explores ways in which videotherapy can lead to a revitalisation of
the concept of the therapeutic relationship, in order to meet the challenges
associated with COVID-19. A number of specific considerations for videotherapy
adaptations and etiquette in the midst of COVID-19 are described.

1 | INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 has forced us to reimagine the way we work and the way
we live. It has also highlighted the impact of physical ill-health and
social disruption on mental health and well-being (AMS, 2020; Holmes
et al., 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020), whilst at the same time
removing our usual first line response to mental health challenges:
in-person face-to-face therapy (Wind, Rijkeboer, Andersson, &
Riper, 2020). By the end of May 2020, almost every country was
experiencing restrictions to movement and closure of nonessential
businesses, especially those that require face-to-face contact (Hale
et al., 2020). Perhaps unsurprisingly, in this void, we are confronting
levels of distress and anxiety in our local and global communities
on an unprecedented scale (Frissa & Dessalegn, 2020; Holmes
et al., 2020). This distress is not restricted to pre-existing mental
health clients or even to groups at high risk of mental health
challenges (MORI Ipsos, 2020). It is not restricting itself to the old or
to the young, to women or to men (World Health Organisation
[WHO], 2020a). Whilst we have known that mental health challenges
have been a silent epidemic for decades (Whiteford, Ferrari, &

Degenhardt, 2016), early evidence suggests that the current trajectory
of symptomatic presentations is likely to exceed the pandemic trajec
tory of the COVID-19 virus itself, as it affects not just the lives of
those with the virus but also frontline healthworkers (Greenberg,
Docherty, Gnanapragasam, & Wessely, 2020), and the lives of the
many people living in fear of the virus or dealing with the personal,
social and economic consequences of the virus (AMS, 2020; Silva,
Resurrección, Antunes, Frasquilho, & Cardoso, 2020). It is often said
that necessity is the mother of invention. In the case of ‘videotherapy’,
the provision of synchronous psychotherapy via videoconferencing, it
seems that necessity may be the mother of reinvention (Knopf, 2020;
Torous, Myrick, Rauseo-Ricupero, & Firth, 2020). This evidence-based
technological option for therapeutic contact may finally have an
opportunity to live up to its potential as communities around the
world move rapidly online and where videoconferencing communica
tion is the new normal (Berwick, 2020). Further, synchronous video
conferencing sits amongst, and can be used alongside, a suite of
digital mental health modalities or ‘psycho-technologies’, including
text-chat, audio calls, virtual reality, mental health apps and online
forums (e.g., Stubbings, Rees, & Roberts, 2015).
Even prior to COVID-19, more than 80% of those in developing
countries were unable to access traditional treatment for mental
health problems (United Nations, 2020). In developed countries, there
is still a significant treatment gap, with evidence suggesting between
44% and 70% of those needing mental health care are unable to
access evidence-based treatments (WHO, 2019). The current acute
imperative for psychotherapists to incorporate videoconferencing and
other forms of remote technology builds upon this pre-existing unmet
need. Community wide isolation (Hale et al., 2020; Pietrabissa &
Simpson, 2020) is occurring at the same time as exposure to trauma
and the significant psychological impact of more than 30 million cases
of COVID-19 illness worldwide, grieving for more than 943,000
deaths (WHO, 2020b), and adapting to rapidly changing social and
economic conditions (United Nations, 2020).
Early studies described videotherapy as a solution to the provi
sion of mental health services for those living in remote and rural
areas (Thomas, Ellis, Konrad, Holzer, & Morrissey, 2009), as well as
those unable to attend in-person sessions due to factors such as ill
health, reduced mobility, incarceration and/or working off-shore
(e.g., Langarizadeh et al., 2017; Simpson, 2009). Our unprecedented
current global circumstances bring this need into the ‘mainstream’.
Fortunately, the extraordinary development of information and com
munication technologies and expansion of the internet has ensured
ubiquitous infiltration of e-technology into all spheres of our lives,
thereby promoting greater tolerance of and engagement with technol
ogy, including, increasingly, in the sphere of mental health and psy
chotherapy (Weitz, 2018). Recent figures indicate that approximately
56% of the world's population utilises the internet (Roser, Ritchie, &
Ortiz-Ospina, 2020). For some time now, surveys in the United States
have suggested that 80% of North Americans access information
about mental health via the internet and increasingly rely on it to
meet their psychological needs (Elkin, 2008). Over recent months,
COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented digital transformation in the
marketplace, impacting human behaviour across almost all aspects of
daily life (Kim, 2020; Yan, 2020) further creating a digital ‘skills-ready’
and ‘receptive’ marketplace for videotherapy (Hong, Lawrence,
Williams, & Mainous, 2020). Further, the risk–benefit ratio has tipped
in favour of telehealth, at least partly due to the fact that clinicians are
as at risk as their patients. This has resulted in a rapid shift in attitude
of clinicians in favour of using technology, and overhaul of the red
tape that has restricted the growth of this field (Webster, 2020).
2 | VIDEOTHERAPY: FACTORS AFFECTING UPTAKE
Historically, despite the documented need, promising outcome studies
(Backhaus et al., 2012; Nelson & Patton, 2016; Richardson, Frueh,
Grubaugh, Egede, & Elhai, 2009) and client acceptance (Simpson &
Reid, 2014a) uptake has been slow (Austen & McGrath, 2006; Perle
et al., 2013; Perle, Langsam, & Nierenberg, 2011; Pierce, Perrin, &
McDonald, 2020; Richardson, 2012; Roine, 2008; Simpson, Guerrini,
& Rochford, 2015; Wagnild, Leenknecht, & Zauher, 2006). Most nota
bly, it has been therapists rather than their clients who have been
slow adopters of technology (Simpson & Reid, 2014a). Typical chal
lenges raised by clinicians regarding the use of videotherapy include
concerns around obtaining informed consent and capacity to guaran
tee client confidentiality. Additionally, the logistics of managing crises
can be more complicated due to reliance on internet-based communi
cation (Rochlen, Zack, & Speyer, 2004). Further concerns arise in rela
tion to reduced opportunity to verify clients' identities and location
when meeting with them remotely (Rochlen, Zack, & Speyer, 2004).
Following the onset of the pandemic, we have seen a rapid uptake of
telemental health technology amongst more than 3000 therapists sur
veyed in the United States (Sammons, VandenBos, & Martin, 2020).
Indeed, there was an increase in uptake from 30% to more than 80%
becoming frequent users over a period of just weeks. Nevertheless,
therapist concerns remain about the use of videotherapy (Sammons
et al., 2020) and must be addressed to support the sustainability of

videotherapy practice throughout and beyond the life of COVID-19.
Historically, therapists and service providers have identified three
main concerns: (i) access, (ii) cost and (iii) therapeutic viability.
2.1 | Access
Access issues have included concerns for a digitally illiterate client
base with lack of access to suitable technology (Lazarus &
Mora, 2000). As described above, COVID-19 (and indeed the years
leading up to COVID-19) has mitigated this concern through a world
wide digital transformation. With the ubiquitous availability of mobile
phones, telehealth is becoming increasingly accessible to even the
most disadvantaged. Over recent months, digital technologies are
being used across developed and developing countries alike to reach
those most in need. In India, virtual health care is more accessible
through the public health care system than through private hospitals.
Both Chinese and Indian governments have released a range of online
applications that allow videoconferencing and instant messaging
options to increase access to health care and information, including
WeChat and WhatsApp (Webster, 2020). Alongside other digital tech
nologies, videotherapy may improve equity of access to psychological
services, to facilitate inclusion of those who are constrained by factors
such as geographical remoteness, medical and psychiatric illnesses,
mobility issues, incarceration and financial hardship (Joint Task
Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for
Psychologists, 2013).
The other side of this equation is access for therapists—there
have been very few post graduate clinical and counselling programs
that include training on online and videoconference-based therapies,
with the exception of a notable few (e.g., Dunstan & Tooth, 2012;
McCord, Saenz, Armstrong, & Elliott, 2015; Pierce, Perrin, &
McDonald, 2020; Richardson, 2012; Simpson, Guerrini, &
Rochford, 2015; Simpson, Rochford, Livingstone, English,
& Austin, 2014), nor professional development opportunities, which
contributes to concerns and negative expectations (Springer,
Bischoff, Kohel, Taylor, & Farero, 2020). The practice of videotherapy
requires specialist skills and knowledge to address unique practical,
ethical and legal challenges (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020).
Again, COVID-19 has generated an urgent call and rapidly growing
availability of telehealth training opportunities (Smith et al., 2020;
Wosik et al., 2020). Online training courses that offer certification
in the use of specific digital technologies for psychotherapy
are becoming increasingly available (e.g., www.telehealth.org;
http://onlinetherapyinstitute.com).
National and international professional organisations have also
developed videotherapy guidelines in recent years and provide
comprehensive practical and ethical recommendations (e.g., American
Psychiatric Association, 2016; Joint Task Force for the Development
of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013; New Zealand
Psychologists Board, 2012; Shore et al., 2018; Turvey et al., 2013;
Yellowlees, Shore, & Roberts, 2010). Importantly, in the current
context, these provide guidance on requirements for safe practice at
a distance.
2.2 | Cost
Cost barriers to videotherapy have also been significantly overcome
during COVID-19. In countries such as Australia and the United
States, recent months have seen the introduction of a Medicare
rebate for working with clients using videotherapy, which overcomes
previously restrictive criteria and addresses issues of social equity in
access (Smith et al., 2020). Public mental health services that have also
historically been slow to embrace the advantages associated with
utilising technology in the delivery of therapeutic services (despite
potentially large cost-savings and more seamless multidisciplinary
treatment delivery) (Hilty et al., 2013) have been rapidly pivoting
towards telehealth delivery and revitalising telehealth infrastructure
(Whaibeh, Mahmoud, & Naal, 2020).
2.3 | Therapeutic viability
Therapeutic viability is the final barrier to successful adoption of
videotherapy—this is the primary concern for clinicians and the focus
of this paper. Specifically, viability concerns centre on a perceived
interruption to the therapeutic alliance—a disruption to the core
mechanism for change and the most reliable predictor for both out
come and attrition (Horvath, Del Re, Flückiger, & Symonds, 2011;
Wampold & Imel, 2015). One seminal study demonstrated that
psychologists tend to rate therapeutic alliance lower for a session that
was conducted via videoconferencing compared with in-person, even
when the session was identical across both settings (Rees &
Stone, 2005).
Our paper addresses the concern about therapeutic viability by
exploring what we know about how technology can shape therapeutic
alliance in the context of videotherapy. We go beyond proposing vid
eotherapy as a ‘good enough’ therapy ‘in the current circumstances’
to challenge our basic assumptions about the factors that lead to
effective therapy, including the widely held belief that conventional
in-person treatment methods are the gold standard for all (Simpson &
Reid, 2014b). This is neither wishful thinking borne of necessity nor
an ambit claim. There is already some indication that this treatment
modality may in fact enhance outcomes for some client groups, most
notably, those with mood disorders and/or interpersonal avoidance,
who may find in-person sessions overwhelming (Nelson, Barnard, &
Cain, 2003, 2006; Richardson, Frueh, Grubaugh, Egede, & Elhai, 2009;
Simpson, Bell, Knox, & Mitchell, 2005; Simpson & Slowey, 2011).
Indeed, a randomised controlled study by Nelson, Barnard, and
Cain (2003) compared in-person therapy and videotherapy for depres
sion and found a significantly more rapid reduction in depressive
symptomatology in the technology-based modality.
Reynolds, Stiles, Bailer, and Hughes (2013) refer to the ‘online
calming hypothesis’, claiming that many therapists and clients experi
ence the online environment as more comfortable and less threaten
ing than the in-person setting, as shown by evidence that therapists
and clients experience low arousal levels in online therapy. The addi
tional safety experienced in this context may make online or
videoconferencing-based therapy a less threatening option, especially

for anxiety-based disorders, such as social phobia, agoraphobia, obses
sive compulsive disorder and other groups who find close contact
overwhelming, such as autistic spectrum disorders (Reynolds, Stiles,
Bailer, & Hughes, 2013; Stubbings, Rees, & Roberts, 2015).
We know that many clinicians inexperienced with video
technology report deeply held concerns that the technology will
inhibit the development of therapeutic alliance due to the perception
of the ‘screen’ as a barrier between participants (Morland et al., 2010;
Rees & Stone, 2005; Suler, 2004). COVID-19 has brought many clini
cians to videotherapy who have little previous experience or training.
In this context, it seems likely that concerns about alliance may be fur
ther heightened by the fact that pivoting to videotherapy is occurring
rapidly and during a time in which isolation and therapeutic separation
is not by choice and may be prolonged (Sammons et al., 2020). We
hope that this paper will provide some reassurance and guidance to
therapists coming to videotherapy for the first time.
3 | THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE IN PSYCHOTHERAPY VIA VIDEOCONFERENCING
Twenty-four studies that had examined therapeutic alliance in the
context of videotherapy over the past 23 years were evaluated in a
narrative review by Simpson and Reid (2014a). Although the wide
range of technologies (Skype, ISDN- and IP-based videoconferencing,
FaceTime etc.) and clinical groups being studied made comparisons
difficult, some themes did emerge. There was a clear trend across
studies that indicated high ratings of therapeutic alliance, with clients
rating bond and presence that were commensurable with ratings of
in-person settings across a range of clinical populations. Across the
majority of studies, both therapists and clients rated high levels of
therapeutic alliance, although in general clients ratings were compara
tively higher from the earliest phase of treatment. Rapid adaptations
to the pace and pattern of communication were observed both in
therapists and clients early in videotherapy. Indeed, videotherapy
appeared to be associated with an increased investment in the
therapy process and greater tolerance in the case of disruptions and
interruptions to planned sessions—perhaps due to an understanding
of the potential glitches that take place when relying on technology
and connecting at a distance (Bischoff, Hollist, Smith, & Flack, 2004;
Manchanda & McLaren, 1998). There was some evidence that
therapists find it easier to communicate with children and teenagers
by videoconferencing (e.g., Himle et al., 2006, 2012) due to their
familiarity with technology for gaming and communication. Indeed,
client ratings indicated a consistent preference for videoconferencing
over in-person therapy. Only two studies reported higher alliance
ratings in the in-person condition: one investigated group anger
management for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, (Greene
et al., 2010; Morland et al., 2010) and the other was with teenagers
diagnosed with seizure disorders and their parents (Glueckauf
et al., 2002). Similarly, a recent study found no significant differences
in the quality of empathy and therapeutic alliance across three
modalities: in-person, telephone and videoconferencing (Reese
et al., 2016). However, client-rated videotherapy alliance has been
shown to be further enhanced for those matched with therapists who
are confident working with psycho-technologies (Frueh et al., 2007).
It has been found that online therapeutic modalities can lead to
greater disinhibition and openness, as a result of a heightened sense
of safety and a more neutral power balance (e.g., Fletcher-Tomenious
& Vossler, 2009; Roy & Gillett, 2008). Indeed, numerous studies have
reported that clients find videotherapy less confronting than in-person
contact, thus facilitating disclosure of difficult experiences and expres
sion of difficult feelings (Simpson, 2005; Simpson, Doze, Urness,
Hailey, & Jacobs, 2001). This may be due to a combination of factors,
such as feeling ‘at a safe distance’ due to the additional privacy
afforded by this therapy modality, especially for those in remote loca
tions who are typically faced with few if any ‘anonymous’ local treat
ment options (Simpson et al., 2003; Simpson, Deans, &
Brebner, 2001). Indeed, it is difficult for rural residents to attend face
to-face mental health clinics within their local town without this being
witnessed by other residents. Videotherapy facilitates attendance of
therapy sessions from the convenience of the person's own home
without concern about being observed or stigmatised. Those clients
who prefer videotherapy over other modalities often cite feeling ‘less
scrutinised’, ‘less self-conscious’ and a greater sense of personal con
trol (Simpson, Bell, Knox, & Mitchell, 2005; Simpson, Richardson, &
Reid, 2016), which may be particularly important when dealing with
shame-related issues (e.g., sexual abuse and body-image disorders)
(Simpson et al., 2003; Simpson, Bell, Knox, & Mitchell, 2005; Simpson
& Morrow, 2010). It may also be that certain client groups who find
intimacy threatening, such as those with an avoidant personality traits,
may be more suited to videotherapy (Simpson, 2009). Similarly, online
and videoconferencing-based therapies may be more accessible to
young males, a particularly at-risk group for suicide, who may avoid
attending traditional mental health services due to fears of
stigmatisation and discomfort around the open expression of emo
tions (Dunn, 2018). These client groups may be particularly at risk dur
ing periods of lockdown due to COVID-19 due to loss of daily
structure, work, income and usual mental health supports.
4 | ADAPTING VIDEOTHERAPY TO THE AGE OF COVID-19
In light of the strong evidence base for videotherapy summarised
above, psychotherapists do not need to be apologetic in transitioning
their clients from in-person to videotherapy sessions but rather view
this as an opportunity to provide a seamless mental health care that
enables clients to stay safe at home, whilst mitigating potential anxi
ety and isolation triggered by COVID-19.
Videotherapy services are being offered in several countries to
support those in need of mental health support (e.g., Liu et al., 2020;
Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2020a,
2020b; Zhou, Liu, Xue, Yang, & Tang, 2020). Medical staff working on
the ‘front-line’ in COVID-19 hospital wards may be especially at risk
412 SIMPSON ET AL.
10990879, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2521 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [15/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License


of mental health issues such as traumatisation and burnout associated
with higher exposure to the virus and working extended hours (Chen
et al., 2020; Greenberg, Docherty, Gnanapragasam, & Wessely, 2020).
Therapeutic support for frontline workers may be an issue of timing
the wave of posttraumatic responses may be yet to come.
4.1 | Therapeutic opportunities
As many clients will be accessing their videotherapy sessions at home,
this will provide a unique opportunity to witness some of the living
circumstances that they have described in sessions. Providing sessions
in the clients' home may enable them to be more comfortable to
experiment with some of the tasks that have been more difficult in
the context of the psychotherapy office, such as exposure-based
tasks, relaxation or meditation. Some of those with posttraumatic
stress disorder can feel threatened by the prospect of sitting in the
middle of an office space but may benefit more from trauma
processing in the safety of their own home. Family pets can also pro
vide an additional element of comfort and familiarity that would not
generally be available in the therapist's office. A client who has been
restricting themselves to one room of the house due to difficulties
such as agoraphobia, or obsessive compulsive disorder, could show
their video therapist the set-up of the room and the house in general,
to explore ways in which their psychotherapy sessions can enable
them to expand their horizons. Those with eating disorders can show
the therapist the room where their binges take place, facilitating a
collaborative exploration of ways they can increase a sense of self
awareness and control within this environment. The unique
contextual circumstances of COVID-19 will continue to challenge us
to collaboratively innovate to maintain core therapeutic conditions.
4.2 | Changing the nature of boundaries and ‘safe’ therapeutic spaces
As videotherapy becomes increasingly common in the COVID era, the
client is more likely to be attending their videotherapy sessions from
within the context of their ‘real lives’, taking place within their own
homes, thereby creating a more organic or personal feel to the con
nection and potentially providing more access to immediate triggers
and transference reactions. It has been suggested that a more neutral
online therapeutic environment may facilitate transference
reactions that are more reality based and meaningful (Dunn, 2012;
Mitchell, 2020; Quackenbush & Krasner, 2012).
Across all therapeutic models, the therapeutic relationship is
based on trust and the discipline-specific codes of ethical conduct
(Badawi, 2016; Bridges, 1999; Brown & Stobart, 2018; Zur, 2007). In
practice, maintaining boundaries is a dynamic process that requires
therapists to draw on their own professional judgements and ethics
(Hermansson, 1997). When therapy takes place in cyberspace, bound
aries need to be flexible enough to embrace the benefits that psycho
technologies offer whilst providing a stable base for containment,
affective attachment, attunement and safety (Sabin & Harland, 2017).
In fact, it has been suggested that a ‘fluid’ construction of boundaries
can facilitate the development of a deeper therapeutic relationship
and sharing of power if the therapist is able to explore their meaning
and purpose as they are constructed and to highlight and explore dif
ferences in perspective as they arise (Bridges, 1999; Totton, 2006a,
2006b). For example, in videotherapy, this may involve an exploration
of the therapeutic connection via the screen and an exploration
of feelings of safety and intimacy associated with location and size
of self-other images on the screen, level of eye-contact, and
experimenting with sitting closer to or further from the camera.
Nevertheless, these changes in setting challenge conventional
notions of where and how therapeutic boundaries are set up and the
way in which the work of therapy takes place. Whilst the flexibility of
psycho-technologies can function to enhance therapeutic rapport, this
can also provide fertile ground for boundary transgressions and viola
tions. In particular, there is a danger that an increase in flexibility of
therapeutic services may lead to a corresponding increase in the fre
quency of contacts, whilst the nature of exchanges has the potential
to gradually become less formal and more casual. In addition, it is easy
to mistakenly assume that the lack of physical proximity equates to
protection from boundary crossings and taken to the extreme can lead
to potentially deleterious effects on the professionalism of the thera
peutic relationship and ultimately therapeutic outcomes. See Table 1
for further suggestions on upholding professional boundaries. These
issues may be minimised through following best practice guidelines
and regular access to professional training and clinical supervision
(Anthony & Goss, 2009; Anthony & Nagel, 2010; Drum &
Littleton, 2014; Luxton, Nelson, & Maheu, 2016; Maheu, Pulier,
McMenamin, & Posen, 2012; Simpson, Richardson, & Reid, 2016).
4.3 | Establishing a collaborative model
From a pluralistic framework, clinical practice should ideally incorpo
rate therapeutic ideas from the wider culture in which they operate,
rather than limiting itself to precepts and methodology from the field
of psychotherapy. Given the scale of the COVID impact on psycholog
ical health and well-being and given restrictions on access to tradi
tional services, we need to find new ways of operating. Therapeutic
outcomes can be enhanced if the therapist is willing to work with their
clients to delineate an approach that fits within their modus operandi
and can provide a functional contribution to resolve problems
(McLeod, 2013). Co-creating a workable videotherapy model with our
clients is part of this emerging challenge. We are finding our way
together through unchartered territory. At the same time that we are
offering access to new videotherapy services, many of our clients will
be transitioning from their workplaces to working from home and
utilising technology to attend work meetings as well as to conduct
many work-related services. Familiarity and comfort with tele
technology is rapidly changing. For recommendations on facilitating
separation of work-related technology space from the therapeutic
space, see Table 1.
The pluralistic approach highlights the importance of actively
seeking out and recognising the client's knowledge and experience of
using technology in order to create new therapeutic possibilities. It

T A B L E 1 Key skills for developing a strong therapeutic alliance in videotherapy
Key skills for developing a strong therapeutic alliance in videotherapy Key reference
Providing a rationale for videotherapy: When explaining the transition to virtual sessions, psychotherapists can introduce videotherapy as part of their overarching commitment to provide the highest quality individualised, secure psychotherapy care. This can either be discussed in-person, or via email or telephone.
Technical induction to videotherapy: Some clients will need to be ‘walked through’ the technology first, as a means of building confidence with the videoconferencing platforms being used. Contingency plans should also be put in place, so that a secondary videoconferencing platform and/or telephone can be utilised when any difficulties arise. Therapists can also briefly describe the security and confidentiality standards associated with the platform, and provide an opportunity for clients to express any concerns or ask questions. Time should also be provided within sessions for questions regarding the use of videoconferencing. Provision of a short information sheet with simple details on getting the most out of videotherapy, can provide reassurance and allay anxieties.
Therapeutic induction to videotherapy: Where possible, offer an in-person session prior to starting videotherapy in order to allay concerns and initiate rapport—It should be noted that in reality this option is generally only taken up by a minority of clients. Information sheets (and Consent forms) can be provided in advance to explain the process and provide back-up forms of contact in case of technology or internet failure.
(Bischoff, Hollist, Smith, & Flack, 2004; Manchanda & McLaren, 1998).
Risk management: A collaborative risk-management plan should be developed and put in writing to ensure that steps are in place for ensuring patient safety. This may include changes associated with steps needed to organise hospitalisation in the case of suicidality or medical instability (e.g., in severe eating disorders and substance misuse). It may also include making sure that the client is in a safe space during the videotherapy session (e.g., not in a situation of acute domestic violence risk that may be triggered by the session)
Communication enhancement (human): Expression of empathy and warmth can be conveyed more ‘actively’ through more regular checking-in to facilitate attunement to clients' emotional responses; ‘leaning in’ to the screen, intentionally using body posture, facial expressions, voice tone and body gestures. The dialogue can be slowed down through increased paraphrasing, summarising, and turn-taking. Therapists may also enquire more regularly to elucidate meanings associated with facial expressions and body movements/position.
(Bischoff, Hollist, Smith, & Flack, 2004; Himle et al., 2006; Lozano et al., 2015; Richardson, 2012; Simpson, 2009; Simpson, Richardson, & Reid, 2016; Tuerk, Yoder, Ruggiero, Gros, & Acierno, 2010).
Communication enhancement (technology): Exploration of feelings of safety and intimacy associated with location and size of self-other images on the screen, level of eye-contact, and experimenting with sitting closer to or further from the camera. For example, by placing the picture of the client in the top half of their screen near to the camera, it may be easier to create an experience of ‘virtual eye contact’, thus creating a greater sense of connection. Clients who find connection and intimacy confronting can be encouraged to ‘play’ with the technology, to experiment with size and location of images and sound, and to zoom the therapist in and out, in order to develop a sense of internal comfort and connection
(Simpson & Francesco, 2020)
Therapists can monitor and adjust their verbal and nonverbal responses through self-monitoring via the ‘P in P’ function (i.e., the self-image that appears on the screen). Clients can also utilise this function to attain valuable information regarding their own communication, or it can be switch off if preferred.
(Bouchard et al., 2004)
Sharing control: Clients have been reported to be more active in videoconference sessions, which may be linked to the democratising effect of being situated in their own ‘territory’ with responsibility for their own remote control and screen
(Day & Schneider, 2002; Simpson et al., 2003).
Maintaining boundaries: Maintain therapeutic boundaries through (1) establishing a therapeutic contract, clarifying time and financial and confidentiality commitments; (2) not accepting social media invitations from clients and maintaining a professional tone and manner in both video- and text based (e.g., emails and SMS) engagements; (3) where possible, maintaining consistency and predictability by keeping sessions to a regular time and ensuring that they begin on-time;

Key skills for developing a strong therapeutic alliance in videotherapy Key reference
(4) dressing professionally, as in an in-person setting; (5) ensuring sessions take place in a private space, with minimal background noise.
Session preparation: Therapists tend to spend more time in preparation for videoconferencing sessions, which may play a role in enhancing quality and effectiveness.
(e.g., Richardson, 2012; Simpson, Deans, & Brebner, 2001)
Advanced skills: Once psychotherapists develop a preliminary level of competence with the technology, videotherapy can offer multifarious opportunities for working and connecting in creative ways, such as through uploading drawings or using the ‘whiteboard’ facility to develop collaborative formulations and can even be adapted for experiential techniques such as chairwork and imagery rescripting. Further, incorporating avatar technology into videotherapy can provide a blank canvas or ‘virtual world’, which provides a setting through which client and therapist can co-create and connect. This provides further opportunity for therapist and client to deepen their understanding of the client's inner world
(e.g., Simpson & Francesco, 2020)
COVID-specific etiquette:
There is a COVID-specific etiquette emerging, or at least an etiquette necessary in these unusual conditions to support privacy for client and therapist. Most of our clients are in self-isolation at home, with other family or household members sharing a confined space throughout the day making physical privacy during sessions unrealistic.
Creating a therapeutic space: Clients working from home may need to develop a sense of separation from their ‘workspace’ whilst engaging in their therapy session. If a laptop or telephone is being used, suggest moving from the home office to another location, to create a more personal therapeutic space. Conversely, therapists working from home may need to ensure a sense of being in a ‘workspace’ at home that is separate from their personal or family space. Clients undertaking sessions from work, for examples, frontline healthworkers who may undertake videotherapy from a hospital setting, should be encouraged to ensure that access to the telehealth technology is in a private, bookable space to ensure that work does not impinge on the session, and that they are free to undertake the session without the wearing of a face mask. It may also be helpful to ensure that the session occurs at the end of a shift rather than during a shift-break given the potential for a session to be distressing.
Privacy: The mute function can assist in maintaining privacy by blocking out background conversations or noise. Both therapists and clients can be encouraged to use headphones or earplugs to ensure that other family members cannot overhear or impinge on the therapeutic conversation. App-based artificial backdrops provide protection against seeing each other's homes, particularly when the only feasible space for a session is in a bedroom or other private space. This can operate functionally to screen out the home environment but may also be a form of self-expression through the images chosen.
(Lustgarten, Garrison, Sinnard, & Flynn, 2020).
Social scheduling: Where possible, sessions can be timed to take place during periods of reduced demands around childcare (e.g., evening clinics).
(Lustgarten, Garrison, Sinnard, & Flynn, 2020).
Security: Psychotherapists turning to videotherapy for the first time, or using it for the first time from home, should familiarise themselves with the security settings within their videoconferencing platform, to ensure that calls are secure, confidential and password protected.
(Lustgarten, Garrison, Sinnard, & Flynn, 2020).
Therapist self-care: Supervision via videotherapy is a critical part of providing a therapeutic service at this time. Unusually, both therapist and client are experiencing the COVID pandemic which affords potentially greater opportunities for empathy but also potentially for boundary violations. “Zoom fatigue” has recently entered into our lexicon. Already we are recognising that there is an additional cognitive load of interacting through virtual means for extended periods. It is important that therapists build in breaks to their videotherapy sessions to minimise burnout
(Sander & Bauman, 2020)

involves stepping outside our usual assumptions about what the client
needs and how they need to receive it, by asking about their goals
and requirements from videotherapy, and considering how this can be
practically achieved. This approach proposes that instead of the thera
pist functioning as the primary ‘keeper’ of knowledge, a truly collabo
rative therapeutic relationship involves actively focusing on what
knowledge our clients bring to therapy, including the way they con
ceptualise relationships and dialogue and their expectations and pref
erences of the therapeutic process (McLeod, 2013; Totton, 2006b).
Implementing democracy in the therapeutic arena does not require
the therapist to abandon their role in upholding the boundaries and
professional responsibilities but requires that client experience
remains central in the therapeutic process.
The challenge in working with psycho-technologies will be to find
a balance between managing the fundamental imparity of the thera
peutic relationship whilst facilitating reciprocity and alliance, within a
neutral setting that promotes disinhibition and openness. The thera
pist must negotiate equilibrium between establishing therapeutic
boundaries within the videotherapy environment whilst mindfully lay
ing the foundations for the client's therapeutic experience. This may
in part require maintaining an active awareness of the ‘therapeutic
presence’ and the way in which the therapist–client connection is
maintained. Further suggestions for enhancing therapeutic connection
via videotherapy are listed in Table 1.
4.4 | Who benefits most?
There are many for whom technology offers an opportunity to
access psychotherapeutic treatments that would otherwise be
unobtainable for them. Historically, this has primarily included those
living in geographically rural and remote areas, the elderly, those
impaired by mobility or health issues and the incarcerated. Psycho
technologies may now offer a unique solution not just to these
populations but also to the entire communities in self-isolation due
to COVID 19, improving access and equitability in mental health care
at a time of great, and growing, need. Videotherapy provides a
mechanism that potentially offers equitable access even to specialist
psychotherapy services (such as for addictions, eating disorders,
pain-management, relationship issues, posttraumatic stress disor
der)—as well as those who are shielding family members, juggling
work and childcare from home and those who are contagious and in
acute stages of COVID-19.
4.5 | Equity and access
Psychotherapists should remain aware of social equity issues around
the transition to videotherapy. We must work to ensure that all of the
population, particularly those most in the most socio-economically
disadvantaged populations can access psychological therapy, regard
less of their access to technological equipment and a reliable internet
connection. Indeed, there has been a call for the development of an
evidence-based digital inclusion strategy within the National Health
Service in the UK to facilitate access to internet-enabled psycho
technologies for digitally excluded populations (Robotham,
Satkunanathan, Doughty, & Wykes, 2016). Videotherapy may not be
for everyone, and other remote communication alternatives may need
to be considered for those who cannot access or are uncomfortable
with video-based technology. Other forms of synchronous/
asynchronous forms of psycho-technology such as email, Facebook
Messenger and online chat forums may use less mobile data and be
more accessible for some. The emerging research on suicide
prevention apps is one such example of the way in which psycho
technologies can bridge the gap in access to psychological support
and advice (de la Torre, Castillo, Arambarri, López-Coronado, &
Franco, 2017).
There is an urgent need for improved digital access for those in
at-risk groups with severe mental illness and medical complications
(e.g., acute psychosis and severe anorexia nervosa). This is especially
the case for those who fall foul of the ‘digital divide’ due to social
inequity (Lazarus & Mora, 2000). In particular, older people with psy
chosis appear to be at high risk of exclusion, citing lack of knowledge
as a barrier (Robotham, Satkunanathan, Doughty, & Wykes, 2016).
Facilitating greater inclusion may require efforts to provide suitable
devices (e.g., mobile phones) whilst facilitating development of skills
and confidence with technology in underserved populations. Further,
psychotherapy services could be more proactive in providing a range
of options, such as through provision of loan devices or arranging for
clients to access videotherapy from within their General Practice clinic
or other local health providers, and even workplaces—although these
options may be somewhat limited during COVID-19. Psychotherapists
should also consider videoconferencing platforms which are designed
to work with lower bandwidths, especially for connecting with clients
in areas with lower internet access.
Further detailed guidance is also required for practitioners
working with specific clinical problems as well as particular
populations, such as military personnel, those working in maritime
and/or other off-shore industries, and those in secure mental health
settings. For example, whereas provision of access to psycho
technologies may improve services within forensic treatment units
and prisons, it may also present specific challenges. In particular,
some severely psychotic and/or paranoid clients may be at
increased risk of self-harm associated with using plastic or glass
taken from digital devices (e.g., computers), highlighting the need for
guidance and procedures for prevention and management for
working with high-risk populations via psycho-technologies (Sales,
McSweeney, Saleem, & Khalifa, 2018).
5 | WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?
As we confront the COVID-19 pandemic, we are faced with unprece
dented community-wide need for psychological support. At the same
time, we have unprecedented restriction of access to clinics due to
government dictates about physical distancing that impede the ability

to conduct face-to-face sessions. At times such as these,
psychotherapists need to be creative in finding ways to step up and
address these new needs.
With the combined forces of rapidly unfolding technology-based
health care options and increased consumer demands and expecta
tions, it is vital that psychotherapists meet the challenge of using
these instruments to advance our practice. Regardless of our personal
preferences, if we do not grasp the challenge of shaping the future of
psychotherapy in the context of a technology-driven world, we will
find that increasingly the lead is taken by nonprofessionals who offer
online/internet-based services and psychological advice. Opportuni
ties are arising to facilitate the development of a more expansive role
in which psychological therapists can play a more active part in the
context of ‘virtual’ multidisciplinary services across both general
health and mental health services (Maheu, Pulier, McMenamin, &
Posen, 2012). We can no longer hold-off by using the rationale that
technology-based services might not be as effective—the evidence
base is growing and is strongly in favour of technology-based services,
both in terms of effectiveness of outcomes, therapeutic rapport and
patient satisfaction (Richardson, Frueh, Grubaugh, Egede, &
Elhai, 2009; Simpson & Reid, 2014a; Stubbings, Rees, Roberts, &
Kane, 2013; Sucala et al., 2012). As psychotherapists, we need to con
sider that if we do not utilise the technologies now available to us for
the provision of psychotherapies, this may constitute neglect of our
responsibilities as practitioners to meet the requirements for best
practice (Lazarus, 1994; Richardson & Simpson, 2015; Simpson &
Reid, 2014b). The question is no longer whether or not technologies
have a place in the world of psychotherapy, but how we can galvanise
ourselves to foresee the potential benefits and risks ahead and equip
ourselves to meet the challenge both to deal with the acute mental
health needs associated with COVID-19, and beyond.
The COVID-19 crisis has fast-tracked the challenge for public
health services to embrace new and innovative ways of utilising
psycho-technologies to improve access, efficiency (cost and clinical)
and outcomes in public health service settings. For psychotherapists,
the exponential growth of psycho-technologies provides significant
opportunities for providing online assessments and treatments and
for engaging new clients (Andersson, 2016; Andersson & Cuijpers,
2009) as well as extending our services beyond what was previously
possible through combining technologies to match client need
(e.g., Castelnuovo et al., 2014; Richards, Simpson, Bastiampillai,
Pietrabissa, & Castelnuovo, 2016). High-quality research is urgently
needed into the effectiveness of different forms of technology as
alternatives and adjuncts to current practices, particularly in times of
crisis. Even after the COVID-19 emergency has abated, we will be
faced with addressing the far-reaching mental health impacts of the
climate crisis (Pietrabissa & Simpson, 2020). There is already substan
tial evidence indicating that many people are currently experiencing
trauma inflicted by extreme weather events, conflict and forced
migration. Videotherapy will be required to evolve in order to play a
role in addressing the mental health needs of those affected by this
emerging crisis. It is critical that as practice continues to evolve in this
space, psychotherapists create opportunities for ongoing peer (and
client) consultation and review, whilst taking advantage of online
training opportunities. In adapting to the ‘new normal’, it will be imper
ative for us to creatively and collaboratively develop new practices
and apply basic principles and clinical reasoning to new innovations
rather than simply adopting established protocols.
Research should also focus on identifying the factors that
enhance therapeutic alliance in the context of utilising the range of
psycho-technologies in order to maximise curative potential and to
reach parts of clients' lives that often remain disconnected from the
confines of the therapeutic hour in traditional therapy settings. Fur
ther research is also required to generate guidance on how and when
to best integrate different technologies alongside videoconferencing.
Social media sites and other online forums provide a mechanism by
which we can both access large samples of specific client groups/diag
nostic categories and expedite multisite trials, thereby providing
increased opportunities for collaboration between researchers.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
The arrival of the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic in March 2020
has presented us with both an unprecedented challenge of
community-wide psychological distress and an inability to provide
therapeutic services in the traditional face-to-face format for an
extended period. It requires us to find new ways to meet our duty of
care to current clients and to show leadership in providing access to
therapeutic support for a new generation of mental health clients. In
this rare case, the evidence base has predated the urgent need. Now
we need to trust the evidence base.
There is growing evidence that the digital natives of the younger
generation who have grown up with technology as an integral part of
everyday life and interpersonal connectedness are increasingly
demanding services that match their needs and the world as they
experience it. Our current circumstances in confronting a global pan
demic have required that the rest of us move quickly to also familiar
ise ourselves with these technologies. Our own future as
professionals will be dependent on our ability to coordinate our
efforts to exploit technologies in order to meet the psychological
needs of clients and communities of the coronavirus age.
